        "question": "They stood in a circle—their eyes darting around wildly in their sockets, briefly meeting to exchange uneasy glares. The intensity in the air was so thick it could be cut with a knife. Everyone who had come to the celebration (or had some involvement in it) had been called to the City Hall’s main room, where they all stood growing into cynics as each person sized up the others in the room. It certainly wasn’t the most comfortable moment in the world, and it got only more stressful when a police officer strode into the City Hall, breaking the silence. “Now what’s the trouble here?” By the look of him, he wasn’t pleased to be there. The question hung in the air for a long time before someone finally answered. “There was a theft here, sir,” said Frank Thompson, who had been hanging outside the circle of celebrators. He was the head custodian and overall caretaker of the City Hall, and had a very haggard appearance; his gray jumpsuit was patched in several places, and the key chain at his side, heavily burdened with keys, was rusted. The police officer grunted, displeased at such a vague response. “Give me specifics, sir.” “Someone stole the Veterans’ pins,” broke in Mr. Landry, the son of one of the veterans. His father, who had served since before Vietnam even, had grown too old to speak up for himself and quietly sat in his chair barely looking perturbed. The officer blinked, surprised. “What pins?” The veteran’s son gave a brief description of the pins: they were pure gold, decorative pins that were given out every year at the town’s Veterans Day celebration. Except this year, according to Mr. Landry, they were especially important, because they not only highlighted the services of the veterans (which they always did), but they also celebrated the town’s tenth successful Veterans Day celebration. In the past, the small town had been without the funds to throw such events. But beginning a decade ago, they started doing better financially, and the party seemed more extravagant every year. “Why would someone want to steal the pins?” asked the officer, eying the empty box that he presumed had once contained the ceremonial objects. “I assume they’d be worth a significant sum,” answered Colonel Abraham in a curt tone. Colonel Abraham, a well-known member of the community, had also served in Vietnam. He was among the minority who actually enlisted in the army rather than being drafted. He was a very strong looking man, even in his old age, and he had never seemed to be very nice. There was always a scowl sewn onto his face. “Probably,” agreed the officer, who had stepped through the crowd to examine the box more closely. It was a simple cardboard box, with no corporate insignia on the outside. “Who was the one who brought the box?” he asked. A small, timid delivery boy stepped forward. He shivered as he looked up into the officer’s eyes. “That would be me, s-sir,” he stuttered. “I reckon it was that boy who took ’em,” spat the colonel, glaring at the delivery boy. “He was the first person to be in contact with them. Selfish punk trying to earn a quick buck, huh?” “N-no! It wasn’t me, I s-swear!” he answered. “Quiet, kid,” said the officer bluntly. “Well what about the Landry boy?” yelled the custodian, key chain jangling. “I bet because of how highly he thinks of his daddy, he stole the pins to give them all to him!” “I would never do that,” Mr. Landry responded. “My father would rather not be given a pin, I have to talk him into coming to this celebration every year. You probably had one of the best opportunities to steal the pins, Frank. Or maybe it was you, Colonel?” He turned to the rugged veteran, cheeks red. “We all know about how highly you think of yourself and your services; who’s to say you didn’t do it?” The Colonel, who had grabbed the delivery boy out of anger while Landry spoke, opened his mouth to speak before he was interrupted by the police officer. “Enough. All of you go into the other room until I call you back in. I’d like to speak to the Colonel, the delivery boy (“Ryan Smith,” the boy muttered, feeling resentment when his name was not acknowledged), Mr. Landry and Frank Thompson right now. Gentlemen, please remain here with me.” When everyone else had scurried out of the room, the police officer took a deep breath. Before he addressed the men, he noticed a plug of tobacco near the cardboard box. He picked it up and pocketed it. “So earlier today, Ryan Smith here, the delivery boy, brought the box of pins to City Hall to be handed out to the veterans. Is this correct?” Ryan, along with Mr. Landry, nodded. “What happened to the box once it arrived here at City Hall?” asked the officer. “We opened it to check that the engraving on the pins was correct, and then we went to lock them up,” answered Mr. Landry. “Only the custodian has the key to that room.” The officer asked, “So the missing pins were locked away, until ...?” “Until I was sent to get them,” finished Colonel Abraham, whose statement was punctuated by the sound of the custodian spitting chewed tobacco into a nearby cup. “Did you get the key from the custodian?” asked the officer. “Yes,” he answered. “And when I unlocked the room, the box was empty.” The police officer grimaced when the custodian spat more chewed tobacco into a cup. “Will you stop that, sir? It’s disgusting. Not to mention very unhealthy, you know.” “Sorry sir, the Colonel here got me into the habit. I don’t normally chew, all I have is what’s in my mouth, which the Colonel gave me a little earlier,” the custodian said, slightly digressing. Struck by a sudden revelation, the police officer smirked. “I think I know who did it.” Who stole the pins?",

        "question": "\"I'm 75 years old,\" shouted Mr. Ferguson, \"and I like Curious George!\" Everyone in the library stared at Mr. Ferguson, and Mrs. Yee, the librarian, glared, like she was trying to will him to talk more quietly. Even Mr. Ferguson's white hair seemed, like it was puffing away from his head in little tufts. But he was arguing with a seven-year-old! Mr. Ferguson had a round face and round eyes, and he looked like an angry pancake as he leaned down to make his point. \"The pictures are still funny!\" Mr. Ferguson insisted. \"And I'm glad when the monkey gets some help from his friend, the man with the yellow hat!\" Seven-year-old Skyler looked at him suspiciously. \"Maybe the books remind me of when I was young,\" Mr. Ferguson added wistfully. \"Back then, I had my whole life ahead of me.\" \"But now you're too old,\" said Skyler, and kicked him in the shins. Mr. Ferguson hated children, but he loved children's books. For 75 years he'd lived in Granville, but he'd never visited the library before. Now he visited every day, always checking out one of the tiny yellow Curious George books with their funny, cartoony illustrations. It was embarrassing when Skyler kicked him, or the librarian gave him a scolding look, but he really enjoyed the books. (And it was cheaper than going to the movies!) Sometimes Mr. Ferguson's eyes lingered over the pictures, and he imagined what it would be like to live on an island far away, like the monkey in the Curious George books. The daydreams were so wonderful, that it sometimes took a long time before he'd turn to the next page. But now Mrs. Yee was stomping over towards the children’s section to scold the two noisy patrons. Skyler took off to hide behind a tall bookshelf, expecting Mr. Ferguson to come and chase him. Despite all of this, Mr. Ferguson still thought most days in Granville to be pretty boring. The library was next to a water silo that said \"Granville\" in bold black letters, and there wasn't much to see on the one road through town. Granville Avenue had just a few stores on either side, plus a narrow building that doubled as the sheriff's office. When the children grew up, they moved away from Granville, and if you stayed, like Mr. Ferguson did, life was pretty quiet. Maybe that's why Mr. Ferguson liked the library so much. But there was one story that Mr. Ferguson had never read. The Granville public library had 34 different books that were all about the life of his favorite funny monkey. There was \"Curious George Goes to a Costume Party\" and even \"Curious George Goes to the Library.\" But now Mr. Ferguson was crouching by a floor-level shelf in the library's small children's section. He pointed his spectacles towards the books' spines so he could read every title for the book he was still looking for. “Curious George and the Pizza” Every day he’d looked through the other 33 books for that title. And every day it was gone. \"Checked out by someone else,\" he muttered, and that only made him want the book more. He never told any of the children which book he wanted and least of all, Skyler. But today, yet again, he'd have to check out a different book instead. Mrs. Yee, the librarian, seemed glad that the children's section had quieted down. Sometimes she wished she could throw out the noisy people and reserve the library for just quiet people. Yes, she'd read a story out loud every Wednesday at 2 p.m. for the children, but even then she talked in a soft, careful voice. Walking sadly to the checkout desk, Mr. Ferguson carried his second choice: \"Curious George at the Ballet.\" He tried not to look at the teenager behind the checkout desk, an intelligent looking youngster wearing glasses named Dexter. As Dexter ran his book over a laser scanner, Mr. Ferguson asked a question that would lead to a complicated mystery. Is it possible that a book could be stolen? \"There's no way!” said Dexter proudly -- pointing to the library's new anti-crime system. \"Our computer's pretty old so it can only track the adult books and the mysteries.\" But then he pointed to two tall rectangular panels, one on either side of the door. They were white and looked ordinary, but there was a fat wire connecting the two panels, and it led to a grey metal box on the wall by the checkout desk. \"Every book in this library has a small radio frequency transmitter.” Dexter said. \"If you tried to walk out the door with a stolen library book…” And then he pulled a book from the stack, and carried it over to one of the panels. The box on the wall made a very loud ringing sound as Mrs. Yee squealed in surprise. Dexter smiled proudly and said, \"It's not possible to steal a book. The alarm bells will always go off unless the book has been checked out.\" Mr. Ferguson said it seemed like a waste of time, which offended Dexter. It seemed like Mr. Ferguson was always offending people. He was sorry that he'd raised his voice today at the 7-year old, although earlier in the week he’d even raised his voice at Dexter! (\"It's never here!\" Mr. Ferguson had shouted. \"I check every single day, but the book that I want is never here!\" It had been early in the morning, and he'd been feeling cranky. He'd walked over a mile to get to the library only to once again be disappointed.) But on that day, shouting didn't seem to help. \"Shh!\" Mrs. Yee said fiercely. \"Maybe I'll feed the book to my dog and then you'll never come back and make noise in my library.\" Dexter smiled like he thought that was a good idea, so Mr. Ferguson just took a deep breath and checked out a different book instead: \"Curious George goes to the Dentist.\" But Dexter seemed happy today, proud to be triggering the loud alarm bells. \"See?\" he said smugly. \"It's just not possible to steal a library book.\" \"Except last Wednesday,” Mrs. Yee said angrily, just so she could disagree with Dexter. “What happened last Wednesday?” Mr. Ferguson asked. \"At 2:00, the box shorted a fuse for 10 minutes.” Dexter grumbled quietly. \"Because Dexter plugged a slide projector into the same circuit!\" teased Mrs. Yee. *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* The next day, there was a police car parked in front of the library. The sheriff's office was only two blocks away, but Granville's sheriff liked having an excuse to drive the police car around. \"I'm on official business,” he said to the librarian. \"What's that?\" asked Mrs. Yee, suspiciously. The sheriff looked down and mumbled under his breath. \"I need a copy of 'Curious George and the Pizza.'\" \"What?!\" squawked Mrs. Yee. The sheriff's face turned bright red, and he looked really uncomfortable. \"It's not for me,\" he said. \"The governor's family is having lunch in Granville today, and my wife wants to read a story to their kids. The governor is Italian-American, so she wants to read a children's book that's about pizza.\" Mrs. Yee was so excited about the governor that she clapped her hands loudly while Dexter checked the computer's records for the book. \"It says it's here -- it should be in the children's section.\" But the sheriff shook his head. The library had just opened, but he'd already checked in the children's section, and the book wasn't there. Mrs. Yee started to panic, while Dexter just looked hurt. \"Our library's anti-crime system is foolproof!\" \"There he is!\" shouted Mrs. Yee, pointing at Mr. Ferguson. \"He asks for that book every day! Arrest him!\" Mr. Ferguson glared back at Mrs. Yee, and then -- acting like a librarian – he said \"Shh!\" He was feeling even crankier than usual -- it was hot outside. And he didn't even think it was possible to arrest someone over Curious George. \"How come you're so sure I stole it?\" Mr. Ferguson said. \"I'm not the only one who wanted it. Mrs. Yee threatened to feed the book to her dog so I'd stop coming around making noise in your precious library. And when she said it, Dexter laughed! Maybe he stole it, and then hacked into the anti-crime system.\" \"Maybe Skyler stole it,\" Dexter suggested with a smile, \"just to keep Mr. Ferguson from having it.\" \"Does Skyler hate Mr. Ferguson?\" the sheriff asked. \"Well, he kicked him in the shins once,\" Dexter said. \"What are we going to do?\" wailed the sheriff. \"The governor's coming, my wife's counting on me -- and I want my Curious George!\" Can you help the sheriff find the book? Who stole the book?",

        "question": "Summertime in the southwest is hot. Often, the days are filled with blazing dry heat in July and August, after the humidity of early summer ends around the Fourth of July holiday. And so it was on a hot August afternoon when a group of friends met with the intention of going swimming. It had been decided that morning that Tim McNair and his girlfriend, Linda Sheldon, would join their friends at David Kelly’s home before heading to one of their community’s neighborhood pools. As there were six of them, it was determined that at least two cars would be needed to travel the three miles to the pool. It would be a birthday celebration, as Tim’s birthday was the next day. First, they would have lunch at the Kelly home. David and his girlfriend, Nancy, Larry Roberts and Donna Allen were at the Kelly home when Tim and Linda arrived just after noon. It was already 93 degrees outside and getting hotter. Tim drove an early 1980s model compact car that was noisy but ran smoothly and offered dependable transportation. When Tim parked in front of the Kelly home, he and Linda could feel the heat of the hot asphalt beneath their feet, even through their thin sandals. As they approached the front door, Mrs. Kelly, David’s mother, greeted them warmly as she invited them into her home. Smiling, she said, “Hi Linda. Hello Tim. Are you ready for sandwiches and iced tea?” “You bet!” Tim replied, with enthusiasm. “Yes ma’am,” offered Linda. “Glad to have you here,” answered Mrs. Kelly. “You will have to excuse the house being a bit uncomfortable. The air conditioner isn’t working properly.” The newcomers joined the others at the kitchen table. As they were the last to arrive, they were also the last to finish eating. While Tim wolfed down his peanut butter sandwich and drank his iced tea, Larry and Donna excused themselves to go change into pool clothes. After visiting with Tim and Linda for a few minutes, David and Nancy excused themselves for the same reason. Linda and Tim spent the next few minutes finishing lunch and visiting with Mrs. Kelly. Mrs. Kelly was a wonderful lady who had a very nice way with young people. As they visited, Tim heard noises coming from outside the kitchen. Though, he didn’t think anything of it, as he knew his friends would be preparing to leave for the pool. A few minutes later, Tim and Linda left the kitchen for the living room. Donna and Nancy were sitting on the sofa. Donna wore a two-piece bathing suit with a towel wrapped around her and a pair of dirty sneakers. Nancy was dressed in a similar swimsuit and sat next to her with an insulated case of soft drinks by her bare feet. Larry and David were nowhere in sight. Tim asked where they were. “Getting ready for the pool, I guess,” said Donna. Tim felt that something was not quite right, but couldn’t put his finger on it. This time, he asked Nancy if she knew where they were. She replied, simply, “I don’t know.” Just then, David and Larry walked in the front door. Tim was startled, as he assumed they were in the back bedrooms changing. Larry had on a t-shirt and swim trunks. David looked a bit silly -- he was already wearing goggles and walking awkwardly in bulky flippers. “Tim asked, \"Where have you guys been?” “Outside,” answered David, “I had to rinse off my flippers.” Tim saw they were still damp. Larry offered, “I went outside with him.” Tim noticed Larry wore a brand new white t-shirt and commented on how fresh it looked. “Yes, it’s new. I just took it out of the package when I changed clothes – look, it still has package wrinkles in it.” Tim still sensed something out of the ordinary. However, he didn’t say anything except, “Well, is everyone ready to go?” His friends looked at each other sheepishly and answered in unison, “Yes.” Walking outside, Tim soon realized why he felt as he did, and why his friends were acting so strange. His car was missing! A light bulb went off in his head when he realized his friends had pulled a birthday trick on him. He was not angry or unduly surprised. After all, he was known for the pranks he pulled on his friends. He expected this playful revenge. Looking at them, he said, calmly, “You stole my car.” “Yes, but only one of us took it. Can you figure out who it was?” asked David. Tim laughed, “Well, I know you have a spare key so it would be easy for any of you to drive it away. But – I didn’t hear it start up when I finished lunch. I’m betting one of you pushed it out of sight. It’s a small, lightweight car and I’m sure one of you simply rolled it downhill and around the block.” “Could be,” said Larry, cryptically. “So, which one of us moved your car?” asked Nancy. Donna chimed in, “Figure it out fast. I’m ready to go swimming!” Tim looked at her and said, “It looks like you are ready for swimming, and I know who moved my car.” Who moved the car?",

        "question": "Larry and Zach agreed about one thing that the military reported a gigantic hot-air balloon that crashed into the desert in 1947, filled with top-secret research equipment. But Zach insisted that this was just a story to conceal what the military really discovered - a mysterious flying saucer from outer space. There was nothing but desert around them, but the highway would lead to Zach's uncle Art. He'd retired to a trailer in the desert and had spent the years watching the skies for asteroids and hoping for the chance to spot lost interplanetary spaceships. But the first mystery was finding where Uncle Art lived! Unfortunately, Zach didn't know the road's name and only remembered that it was the sixth dirt road past state route 246. Larry worried that instead of counting the roads, Zach was concentrating more on convincing him to believe in spaceships! \"Art doesn't say there are aliens landing in New Mexico,\" Zach insisted. \"But at least he keeps an open mind.” Larry finally pointed the truck onto the sixth dirt road, which led to Art's trailer, in back of a fruit stand by the side of the highway. Art flung open the door, thrilled to see his nephew. He was mostly bald, with funny tufts of white hair, and he was wearing faded blue overalls and a red flannel shirt. \"Zach!\" he shouted. \"I'm excited to see you again!\" A young woman also emerged from Art's trailer. \"This is Dora, from the fruit stand next door,\" Art said. \"She brought me fresh vegetables so I could make you boys some stew! I've been telling everyone that I'm getting a visit from two smart youngsters from out of state. Dora was impressed that you'd drive so far just to see your uncle Art!\" And that was when they saw the flying saucer... First there was a strange noise sounding like an engine roaring to life, but then they felt a strange blast of wind. An enormous cloud of dust rose in the darkened desert, along with weird humming noises oscillating up and down. Then a glow started shining from inside the dust cloud. Soon the source of the glow had lifted above the cloud of dust, and they could see what it was -- an enormous metal craft moving slowly towards the sky! \"What in tarnation?\" said Uncle Art, as Zach and Larry stared in amazement. Dora snapped a picture with her ever-present camera, but in the next second - the flying ship was gone! There was nothing but New Mexico darkness and an eerie silence, as the dust cloud billowed up to swallow the rest of the evening sky. They all stood dazed for a moment, but the desert world returned to normal with just the soft sound of crickets and a noisy truck on the freeway behind them. \"Well, son of a gun,\" said Uncle Art. \"Amazing, a flying starcraft!\" said Dora. \"You're under arrest,\" shouted a voice behind them. They turned to see a tall man in a cowboy hat. Art laughed, and said \"That's just Lester. He's a real joker. He runs the gift shop next to Dora's fruit stand. He just got back to America tonight after spending a week visiting his cousin in Italy!\" \"I make jokes to keep smiling!” Lester kidded back. \"There's barely enough visitors to keep the two of us in business. Poor Dora couldn't support her family if it weren't for her husband's construction firm. And unfortunately, I'm not even married!\" They all laughed at Lester's joke, and Uncle Art invited him in for stew. Dora hurried home for the evening, while Uncle Art told Lester what they'd seen. \"You must feel pretty proud of yourself,\" Lester said. \"After all these years of watching the skies, you finally saw something to brag about!\" \"I won't be bragging,\" Art said. \"I don't want a bunch of alien hunters running around in my yard!\" Zach felt a twinge of concern. \"I knew that you'd been watching the skies at night,\" he told Uncle Art, \"but were people making fun of you for it?\" The old man didn't say anything for a second. He just stared thoughtfully, chewing his stew, looking proud and even a little brave. \"You can't let other people tell you what to believe,\" he said firmly. That night Zach and Larry slept in their sleeping bags in Uncle Art's trailer, and when the sun came up, they rushed to where they'd seen the flying saucer. The desert sand was firm, packed down by years of heat and rain. It was easy to see where the blast of dust had come from - a round circle where the sand was mashed down, right in the spot where they'd scene the flying saucer. But there was something else in the sand. \"Tire tracks!\" From the mashed-down sand led a trail of two parallel lines, each line nearly one foot wide, like the treads of a bulldozer. They followed the trailer, but it joined a dirt road that soon led to the highway. \"It sure is dusty here,\" Zach said. \"Look at me! I'm a spaceship!\" He jumped on the ground, and a cloud of dust billowed up around him. He even jokingly tried to make the weird humming noise the spaceship made last night. \"Oo-oo-oo...\" Larry told him that sounded even worse than his singing. When Zach and Larry returned to the trailer, Uncle Art had a concerned look on his face. Even Zach wondered what he was worrying about, and his uncle decided to share a secret. \"Today in the mail I got a strange letter. It's postmarked from Santa Fe, from a TV station. It says 'Please call us to discuss yesterday's flying starcraft.'\" Uncle Art looked genuinely puzzled. \"I've never said I was an expert on aliens!\" \"Are you sure you didn't call them?\" said Lester, from inside the trailer. \"Maybe you want to be a big-shot!\" Lester had been visiting Art when the mailman brought the letter. \"Or maybe it's you who wants to be a big shot,\" Uncle Art replied. \"Some extra publicity certainly would help your gift shop attract more customers!\" \"Or maybe Zach phoned the TV station,\" Larry interrupted. \"You've pestered me for days about the existence of flying saucers, ever since we started driving for New Mexico!\" The four stared bitterly at each other, but finally Larry spoke up in a voice that was calm and certain. \"This letter didn't come from the TV station,\" Larry announced. \"First of all, it is not on letterhead. More importantly, a TV station would call not write a letter about news.” \"I'm beginning to think we didn't see aliens from space,\" Zach admitted. \"We just saw a particularly elaborate practical joke that someone set up in advance!\" \"If you could make a cloud of dust just jumping on the desert,\" Larry said, \"Imagine how much dust you could kick up dropping a fake 'spaceship' on the ground.\" \"But who?” Zach asked. \"Don't worry,\" Larry announced. \"I know exactly who's responsible.\" Who is responsible?",

        "question": "I muttered to myself as my beeper went off. My double shift was almost over and I was drinking my sixth cup of coffee at the all night coffee shop down the street from the station to try and to stay awake. My beeper going off meant one thing and one thing only; someone had been killed and I was needed. Normally, one of the other detectives would have gotten the call, but with a name like Maria Honduras, I was the only non-Irish detective on the small force here in Gallaway, MA. All of the other detectives were off duty, happily celebrating St. Patrick’s Day. I picked up my cell phone and called the station to get the details. Nancy Zinkham had been found murdered in her dressing room at the theatre that evening. I was off at once. Nancy was a huge celebrity comic who came from Gallaway before making it big on TV. However, in keeping with her small town roots, she loved to come back to perform one week a year here in Gallaway, doing a great one person stand up routine for charity. Solving the murder was going to a big deal. It was not just a make or break case, but Nancy had also been my best friend growing up. This was now personal and staying awake was no longer going to be a problem. Quickly, I got to the small theatre and talked to the uniformed policeman standing outside the door to the dressing rooms. “Hi Tom, what have we got?” I asked the patrolman I had known for many years. “Hello gorgeous.” Tom has had a crush on me since grade school. “As usual, Nancy spent the entire day in her dressing room alone. She arrived about 7 am this morning with her yoga mat, her organic salad and 2 bottles of water. Her instructions are pretty simple. No one bothers her for any reason prior to the show. She just spends the entire day in her dressing room doing yoga and meditating to get ready for the show. However, when she did not appear for the opening act, one of the stage hands went to check on her and found her dead in her dressing room.” “Who was back there in the dressing rooms today?” I asked. “No one is really sure” was the unfortunate reply. Prior to inspecting the dressing rooms, I talked to the theatre manager, Dan Gallagher. Dan told me that there were three dressing rooms in the back. All were about the same size, though usually the star got one and the other two were used for the remaining actors and actresses. Each dressing room had a bathroom, a small refrigerator and a sink. That explained how Nancy was able to spend all day in her dressing room. I asked Dan who might have been in the dressing rooms that day. He told me there was no real way to know as lots of people were back there throughout the day. That was when I noticed the video camera above the doorway to the dressing rooms. I asked Dan about it and he told me that yes, there was video of the hallway that we could check. I sent Dan and Tom to get the video. I told Tom to watch the video on fast-forward from early this morning till now to see who went through that door. Meanwhile, I was going to inspect the scene of the crime. By this point, I was really regretting that sixth cup of coffee. I certainly did not need the caffeine to stay away and my bladder was well past full. The first two dressing rooms yielded nothing unusual, which did not surprise me. After all, there was no one using them all day. There were however, bagels in the refrigerator of the second dressing room. Given the late hour, I was tempted to taste test them for freshness, but decided against it in deference to my figure. Now it was time to check out Nancy’s dressing room. Walking into her dressing room, I saw her lying on the floor with a knife in her back. Someone was going to pay for this. I spent about 15 minutes carefully inspecting her dressing room. Everything was as I expected to find it. There was a yoga mat on the floor, numerous empty water bottles and empty salad containers in the trash and another bottle half empty on the table. The coroner would determine the time of death, but based upon her arrival at 7 am, I was guessing a late afternoon demise. By now, the coffee got the best of me. I quickly went into the bathroom, put down the seat and felt relief. It was time to go see who had been back here. By now, Tom and Dan were done looking at the video. Tom told me that there were four people who were in the dressing area the entire day: Kevin Doyle, the owner of the theatre, two actresses appearing in the next show and a cleaning lady. Each of them went in separately and came out less than ten minutes later. Unfortunately for me, all of them had been carrying something large enough to hide a knife, so they were all suspects. None of them seemed like obvious choices, so I told Tom to round them all up and have them meet me in the station the next morning. At that point, the Coroner had arrived and I gave him the lay of the land. He promised me he would have some initial results to me in time to interview the suspects in the morning. Before facing the four suspects, one of whom had killed an old friend of mine, I called the Coroner to see if he had anything for me. He confirmed that Nancy was killed with a knife and that the time of death was late in the afternoon. Other than that, he had nothing as of now. There were no fingerprints on the scene and no other clues of a note. It was time to face the suspects in the order they appeared on the video. First, I talked to the two actresses, Joanne Driscoll and Helen Smith. The two of them were co-staring in the next performance, a comedy, which was starting in two days. “What were you doing in the dressing area yesterday?” I asked them. They suddenly looked nervous. “We were rehearsing with the rest of the cast all morning. The director had brought the best bagels along with a great selection of spreads,” stammered Joanne. “Yes,” Helen added. “I did not want them to go to waste. So, when rehearsal broke for lunch around noon, I took the leftovers to the refrigerator in the actress’s dressing room.” “Did you happen to talk with Nancy” I asked her pointedly. “No way.” “Joanne, what were you doing in the dressing room?” “I got tied up going over some new lines with the director. Since the lunch break was only half an hour, I did not have time to go out for lunch, so I ran to grab one of the leftover bagels. And no, I did not talk to Nancy.” Next it was Kevin’s turn. Any particular reason you would be in the dressing area yesterday, I asked calmly. “Of course there is. As the theatre owner, I make rounds several times a day of the entire theatre. Among other things, I check to make sure that Tina the cleaning lady is doing her job. Before you ask, no, I did not happen to talk with Nancy at all yesterday. On top of that, no, I did not have any reason to wish her ill will. Every year she came back and packed the theatre every night for a week with her charity routine. Every penny from the sale of the tickets goes to charity and her shows are the only ones all year that fill the house.” Muttering under my breath that I was running out of possible suspects, it was time to talk to the cleaning lady, Sarah Jones. She was the last one in the dressing area. I asked her about why there were no fingerprints anywhere. “My job is to make sure that everything is clean throughout the theatre. I dust, vacuum and empty the trash. I do my job well, though I never clean Nancy’s dressing room while she is there. She is always in it and does not want to be disturbed. I just clean it well before she arrives and I clean it again when she leaves at the end of the week. No one goes in the dressing room but her.” Something told me I needed to keep questioning the cleaning lady, so I kept after her for another half an hour. Finally, one of the other detectives stuck his head in the room and asked if I wanted a cup of coffee. I snapped at him and told him no, I did not want a cup of coffee; I was solving a murder investigation. Then it hit me. I knew who did it. Who is the killer?",

        "question": "Rochester was glad it was his turn to walk the dog. He generally didn't like to do this chore when company was over, but since Malcolm, the school bully, was one of those visitors he welcomed the chance to get away. Malcolm and his mother, Dr. Von Beddinglam, were over that night to meet Colonel Greenerbaum. Colonel Greenerbaum was a client of Rochester's father. Rochester's mother thought the single Dr. Von Beddinglam and the single Colonel Greenerbaum would want to meet. It turned out to be a bad idea as Colonel Greenerbaum was not nearly as nice as Rochester's parents thought. Rochester's mother reminded Rochester to be very careful while walking the dog, after all Rochester was still in the 6th grade. Rochester assured his mother he would and then zipped up his jacket and grabbed Fido's leash. \"It was nice meeting you Colonel Greenerbaum,\" said Rochester. \"Is it still raining outside?\" grumbled the colonel. \"It was raining cats and dogs early today, made my Cayman S Porsche all muddy.\" \"I shall see,\" responded Rochester. There wasn't any rain outside but there was the neighbor's cat on the front porch. After a couple of barks and a loud hiss, the dog began to chase the cat and both pets quickly disappeared into the night. \"Oh dear,\" said Rochester. Rochester's parents moaned. This has happened several times before and every time they would tell Rochester to put the leash on Fido before opening the door. Fortunately, Fido always grew tired of chasing the cat after a few blocks and returned home on his own. \"Well, it looks like it hasn't rained in quite a while, colonel,\" said Rochester. The colonel muttered something inaudibly and then left the house without even thanking Rochester's parents for their hospitality. \"How about some lights?\" growled Colonel Greenerbaum as he walked in the dark towards his Porsche. Before anyone could reply, Colonel Greenerbaum took another step and turned on the motion-sensor light above the garage just as he reached his car. \"Thank you for a lovely evening,\" said Dr. Von Beddinglam. She was always polite and always very gracious. \"Let's go Malcolm!\" Malcolm stumbled into the foyer carrying his electric guitar in his right hand. He didn't have a case for his guitar because the police were holding it as evidence. Rochester hated that guitar. For one, Malcolm used Rochester's face as a pick for a 45-minute rendition of \"Smoke on the Water\" and two: it was a left-handed guitar. \"Thank you for a lovely evening,\" said Malcolm pretending to be sincere. Before Rochester's mother could praise Malcolm for his manners, the colonel yelled: \"someone scratched my car!\" Everyone ran outside and saw that there was a foot long scratch on the driver's side door of Colonel Greenerbaum's brand new Porsche. The scratch ran parallel to the car and was as straight as a ruler. The colonel had backed his car up the driveway, meaning the driver's side was directly next to the driver side of Dr. Von Beddinglams car. The front of her car faced up at the house, while Colonel Greenerbaum's Porsche faced down the steeply sloped driveway towards the street. \"This is your fault,\" shouted Colonel Greenerbaum to Rochester's father. \"I'm going to make you pay! This scratch will cost $759.89 to fix!\" Rochester's father asked Colonel Greenerbaum if maybe the scratch had occurred somewhere else but the colonel insisted the damaged had been done while parked in his driveway. \"I love my Cayman S Porsche and its 295 horsepower. I know what every inch of my car looks like at all times!\" Colonel Greenerbaum grabbed a flashlight from his glove box and used it to give Rochester's father a better look at the scratch. \"Look how long it is,\" exclaimed Colonel Greenerbaum. The colonel licked his thumb and rubbed some mud away from the scratch to reveal that it was two inches longer than previously estimated. \"What do you think?\" asked Rochester's mother. \"It looks like a new scratch but I don't know. How can we be sure it happened here?\" wondered Rochester's father. Just then, Fido returned home with his tongue hanging out of his mouth. Rochester quickly attached the leashed to his collar and gave him a little scratch behind the ears. \"Your dog is suspect number one. Look at his collar. It's the same height as the scratch. He could have done it when he chased the cat. I told you it's your fault.\" Rochester's father agreed that Fido could have scratched the Porsche but he still wasn't convinced. \"You're daughter Roxie rode her bike home. Her bike could have done it and that makes her suspect number two.\" Roxie had returned from the library shortly after Colonel Greenerbaum arrived. Dinner was delayed while everyone waited for her to change her clothes. During Roxie's ride home, her bicycle's back tire splashed mud all over her. \"She coasted her bike between the two cars and scratched the car with her pedal.\" Colonel Greenerbaum grabbed Roxie's bike; it was leaning up against the garage door. The colonel positioned the bike so it faced in the same direction Roxie would have been travelling when she came up the driveway. He then positioned the pedal on Roxie's bike at the same height as the scratch on his Porsche. Next the colonel moved the bike forward, but didn't move the pedal, to show how Roxie's bike could have scratched his Porsche while coasting home. \"It's possible,\" admitted Rochester's father. \"I'll go and ask my daughter if she scratched your car.\" Rochester's mother buried her head in her hand. Her daughter would never purposely damage someone's property, but she is so easily distracted that she could have very well scratched the Porsche without even realizing it. \"Why? She'll just lie or you'll lie to protect her. Besides, if it wasn't her then it was the boy and his guitar.\" The colonel claimed to have seen the guitar when he got out of his Porsche and Malcolm's mother admitted it was kept in the back seat on the driver's side. All agreed that the scratch on the Porsche could have been caused by some of the metal parts on Malcolm's guitar. \"Dr. Von Beddinglam told us before dinner that Malcolm was caught once vandalizing a car. He's a juvenile delinquent. I know he scratched my Porsche with his guitar and since it happened on your property you'll have to pay,\" said the colonel. \"But when did Malcolm scratch your car?\" asked Rochester's father. \"When you were in the kitchen doing the dishes. His mother gave him the keys to her vehicle so he could go and fetch his guitar. Here's how he did it.\"\nThe colonel ripped the guitar out of Malcolm's right hand and then demonstrated how he scratched the car while walking back to the house. According to the colonel, Malcolm would have walked back to the house with the Porsche on his left side while holding the neck of the guitar in his left hand. Rochester's father admitted it was very plausible especially the way the cars were parked. Dr. Von Beddinglam asked her son if he had scratched the car and of course he said he didn't. \"It doesn't matter what he says. The kid is a hoodlum,\" proclaimed Colonel Greenerbaum. I gave you three suspects.\" \"You forgot to include yourself,\" remarked Rochester. The colonel glared at Rochester. \"Colonel, one of the suspects can't speak. The other probably doesn't even remember and the third is a known lair. How are we supposed to know what really happened?\" asked Rochester's father. \"I told you there are only three possible ways it could have happened.\" \"You forgot to include the possibility that the car was already scratched,\" remarked Rochester. Again the colonel glared at Rochester. \"Regardless of what your son thinks, or which of the three ways it happened, you are responsible. I demand you pay to have the scratch fixed or I'll take my business elsewhere.\" Colonel Greenerbaum was Rochester's father’s top client. If he lost the colonel's business he could possibly lose his entire business. \"I'm sorry about your car, Colonel. I will pay to have it fixed.\" Rochester's father was dejected but he saw no other around the mystery of the scratched Porsche and no other way to keep the colonel's business. Suddenly, the motion sensor light turned itself off after its long programmable delay period had expired. In another coincidence, the neighbor's cat returned. Fido saw the feline and tried to chase it but all he did was jerked the leash taunt and turn the motion sensor light back on. \"Father,\" said Rochester, \"I know who is responsible for the scratch on the colonel's Porsche.\" Who is responsible for the scratch on the Porsche?",

        "question": "The beach was crowded, and Glen had to be careful as he maneuvered in and out and around the multitude of bathers and sun-worshippers with his metal detector. It was a hot day even for July 1st, not a cloud in the sky and that had brought out the hordes anxious to escape the nitty-gritty furnace of the city. It was only eleven in the morning, but Glen had already made a pretty good haul – $4.65 in loose change, a pair of slightly bent sunglasses, one fully functioning watch and two rings (one of which appeared to be at least 10K gold). People sometimes made fun of Glen as he scouted around with his long-handled magnetic machine, sweeping it back and forth over the ground, headphones on, listening for the beeping sound that signaled buried metal. But he looked at it this way: not only was he enriching himself to a certain extent (to supplement his meager teacher’s pension) and getting some much-needed exercise, but he was also providing a community service. Because along with the valuables, he also uncovered and removed from the dirt or the sand loose can pull-tabs, bottle caps and openers, misplaced keys and other sharp metal objects which could cut unsuspecting bare feet or other body parts, if stepped on or fallen on the wrong way. Glen pushed back the floppy brim of his Tilley hat and mopped his forehead, promising himself a hot dog and cold soda for lunch with the money he’d found. He was up by the entrance to the beach, and as he bent his head and machine back down, he noticed a plastic bag sticking out of the sand about ten feet to his left. Often his bespectacled eyes were just as adept as his metal-detecting machine at finding treasure, and such was the case here. Because as Glen bent down and pulled the sealed plastic sandwich bag out of the sand, he saw that it contained money – lots of it, in bills and coins. He grinned, eyes lighting up like a slot machine that’s hit Jackpot! Then he frowned slightly, noting that the brightly colored bills and large golden and silver coins weren’t good ol’ American greenbacks and change, but rather Canadian currency. Sadly, they were not legal tender in Nebraska, where Glen lived. But the money could still be exchanged at a bank for American cash (at a slight discount, given the Canadian dollar’s lower value relative to the US dollar). Glen’s grin went back up again, as he prepared to open the baggie and count up his loot. Suddenly, though, he was surrounded by four fellow beachgoers who’d seen him pick up the moneybag. They closed in on him, loudly proclaiming the dough as their own. Glen quickly stashed the found money in his fanny pack for safekeeping and then held up his hand. “Hold on, folks!” he addressed the two men, one woman and one child, all of whom were clad in nothing but swimsuits. “What do you mean ‘hold on’?” the stocky blonde man protested. “That’s my money. It dropped out of my pants pocket on my way onto the beach. Now give it here!” “Not so fast, Blondie,” the redheaded woman cut in. “That’s my cash. I put it in the plastic baggie so I could bury it in the sand beneath my clothing – so it wouldn’t get stolen when I went swimming. But I lost it on my way down to the beach.” “That money’s mine, mister!” the tall bald man exclaimed. “I keep it in a plastic baggie when I go to the beach so it doesn’t get wet. I’m Canadian. I’d show you my passport … but I don’t have it with me.” He gestured at his swim trunks. “I’m Canadian, too,” the little black-haired girl stated, looking forlornly up at Glen. “My parents and I are visiting my sick Grandmother down here. That’s all the money I brought with me to buy presents for her. I put it in a plastic bag to take to the bank to change into American money.” She reached for Glen’s fanny pack. He took a step back, holding his metal detector up as a barrier to the avarice crowd. As a former schoolteacher, he knew a little something about the Great White North, having taught North American studies in high school for years. So, like all teachers, he felt that a pop quiz was in order, to identify the true Canuck owner of the Canadian currency. “How many provinces are there in Canada, young lady?” he asked the little black-haired girl. “Ten,” she promptly replied, smiling sweetly. “And what’s the capital city of Canada?” “Toronto,” she responded, just as confidently. Glen turned to the stocky blonde man. “What are Canada’s two official languages, sir?” The man grunted and grinned. “They are English and French, of course.” “And who was the earliest European explorer to discover Canada?” “You mean besides the Vikings?” He scratched his chin. “Well, it was, of course … Jacques Cartier.” He held out a hand for the cash. Glen moved on to the tall bald man, giving nothing away. “What’s on the Canadian flag, sir?” “It is a maple leaf,” the man instantly answered, “a red maple leaf.” “And what is the largest lake situated entirely in your country?” Glen asked. The man hesitated, turning even redder than his sunburn. “Uh, well, that’s kind of a tough one …” The little black-haired girl giggled. “Let’s see, Lake Winnipeg is quite large. And there’s, uh, Great Slave Lake and Great Bear Lake, up in the Northwest Territories.” He shrugged. “To be honest, I’m not a hundred percent sure which is the largest.” The redheaded woman snorted. “Honest, he says.” “Okay,” Glen said, turning to her. “Does Canada have a President, like we do?” The woman smiled. “What is this, twenty questions? We have a Prime Minister.” “And whose picture is on the Canadian one-dollar bill, madam?” “The one-dollar bill? Why, um, that would be … the Queen!” Glen unzipped his fanny pack and pulled out the plastic baggie full of Canadian currency. “I can now return this to its rightful owner,” he stated. Who does the money belong to?",

        "question": "Leon Adams clocked in a few minutes before 10:00 a.m. on a very mild and sunny Tuesday in April, as he was supposed to. It took only a few minutes to open the cash registers in the men’s department. Leon was a suit salesman and he knew from experience that the first couple of hours on a weekday would be very slow. Slow to the point of boredom. So, he was surprised when customers began to show up shortly after opening. The first to arrive was Ed Puckett, (Leon would introduce himself to all of the morning customers and learn their names). Leon greeted Ed as he entered the men’s area. Ed looked around and picked out a few suits to try on in the fitting room. Ed had not been back there long when Leon’s second customer, Louis Murphy, showed up at the cash register asking about a good deal on a sport coat and pair of slacks. Leon helped Louis in finding them and led him back to the fitting room. Meanwhile, Ed was still in the dressing room. Leon was pleased that he had two customers in his area so early -- it was only 10:20. Leon spotted Gene Roberts browsing the edge of the men’s area at 10:25, just after noticing that Ed had left the dressing room. What a busy day! It was difficult to keep track of so many customers. Leon could see Ed wandering in the shoe department, so he moved on to his next sale, greeting Gene and escorting him to the dress shirt table, all the while Louis examined himself in the fitting room’s full length mirror. He hoped Louis would like the sport coat and slacks he was trying on. Although he was some distance away from him, the garments appeared to be a good fit. Justin Tanner came in at 10:30 and asked Leon where the men’s sweaters were. Leon walked Justin over to the sweater table. Justin thanked him and said he wanted to pick one out to try on in the fitting room. As Justin was browsing the sweaters, Leon decided to check on Louis. As he walked back toward the fitting room, he saw Louis walk away from the mirror and return to his dressing room. It was only 10:36 and Leon was having an uncharacteristically busy weekday. At 10:45, Leon saw Justin enter the fitting room with a green sweater and Leon noticed that Louis was still in his dressing room. At 10:50 George Whitley walked over to Leon from the shoe department and asked about a catalog order. Leon placed the order for him at the cash register, but it took a few minutes and he did not finish with it until after 11:00. George paid for the order, which was a pair of dress slacks, and left. At 11:04, Leon noticed Justin leaving the men’s department. He had not purchased the sweater. At 11:10, Leon knew that Louis had never left his dressing room and went to check on him. When he found him, he received the shock of his life. Louis was dead on the floor with a knife wound in his heart. Blood covered the carpeting of the small fitting room. Mercifully, there were now no customers in the men’s department as Gene Roberts had left without trying anything on. Leon held on to his composure long enough to return to the cashier station and call the store security officer, Ronald Clay. Leon’s mouth was hot and dry as Ronald answered his phone, saying simply, “Clay speaking.” Leon stammered, “Ron, get over to the suit fitting room. A customer has been murdered.” Ronald was the retired detective Lieutenant Ronald Clay of the city police department. He came to work at the store after retiring from a 25-year career as a law enforcement officer. There wasn’t much that went on in the store that escaped his attention. Leon was grateful he was on duty and available to handle this nightmare. Clay quickly found the shocked Leon still standing at the cash register. Firmly, but gently, Ronald had Leon lead him to the deceased customer. As soon as Clay saw him he knew who it was. He said, “I know this guy. He’s Louis Murphy. I dealt with him and his friends quite a bit when I was on the Force. He’s known as ‘Louie the Lip’ and is a career mobster.” Weakly, Leon asked, “So you think another crook got to him?” “Yeah,’ Ron replied. “It’s too much of a coincidence for it not to be mob related.” Dryly, he added, “I’ve never seen a person murdered in a department store dressing room before, and I’ve seen a lot.” Within minutes, the store closed and a dozen police officers appeared on the scene. Clay knew that the key to solving the murder quickly rested with Leon, who always knew where men’s department customers were at any given time. Ronald led him back to his office for a quiet visit. He wanted to speak with him before his former associates did. After determining Leon was recovered sufficiently from the shock, he asked him to relate all of the morning’s activities he could remember. Leon remembered everything and relayed the activities and movements of the five customers in detail. Clay listened intently. After considering what he had been told, they went to the video room and reviewed the security tapes. After watching it a couple of times, Ronald told Leon, “This is the murderer.” Who is the murderer?",

        "question": "As Roger headed into the zoo office, he ran into Leonard, a tall man with blond hair. Roger liked Leonard, but sometimes, he went overboard with his practical jokes. He remembered Leonard’s last prank very well. He had snuck Roger’s cowboy hat into the chimpanzee cage. Then Harriet, one of the two chimpanzees, had put it on her head and wouldn’t take it off. Everyone in the crowd that day started laughing. Roger was angry at first but eventually laughed too. “I hope there are no practical jokes today, Leonard,” Roger said. Leonard’s eyes twinkled and then he shrugged. Roger didn’t know what to make of that, but he did know that at least his new hat was safe. Leonard never repeated the same practical joke twice. He said goodbye to Leonard, then walked into the main zoo building. Seated on the bench in front of his office were three students wearing nametags. Roger then remembered that the Zoo manager had asked him to show the students around and figure out who would be the best employee for the summer. The zoo could only afford one of them. Roger was happy to do it as he knew the qualities that the zoo needed. They wanted someone who was knowledgeable, co-operative and loved animals. “Hello, everyone,” Roger said. “Today we’re going to feed a couple of the animals and the four of us will get to know one another. That way I can tell who is most suited to the job.” Tom, a husky boy, sighed. “I hope we’re going to finish this fast, I have to go to a baseball game.” “It’ll take about an hour. “What time’s your game?” “About four,” Tom said. “Should be okay, unless we go into extra innings,” Roger smiled. Roger’s eyes wandered over to the other two students. “You guys care what time we finish?” Cindy shook her head. “No, I don’t have to give blood till seven and I can do my volunteer work at the Church after that.” Tom looked at Cindy. “What are you some kind of saint?” “Just trying to do my part.” Tom grunted. “How about you, Henry?” Roger asked. “I, uh, well...” he said, his right shoulder twitching. “...everything is fine.” The four of them left the building and headed toward the animal cages. The first cage housed the Cockatoo. “This is Wally,” said Roger. He opened a door beside the cage and led the students into a room with a small fridge. Roger had Henry open the fridge and remove a plate of cut fruit and some birdseed. Henry’s hands shook and he accidentally dropped a bit of fruit on the ground. He turned all red. “I’m sorry.” He said. “You’re not going to yell at me are you? I can’t stand being yelled at.” “No, no. Don’t worry, Henry, I drop things too.” Henry nodded then gave the plate to Roger. The students then followed Roger through the door into the feeding area. Cindy moved close to the large white bird. “Hi Wally, what’s up?” Tom stared at Cindy. “I can’t believe you’re talking to that bird. He doesn’t know what you’re saying.” “For your information, Cockatoos are very intelligent. I read they’re as smart as a three year old.” Roger grinned. “That’s right, very good Cindy.” After the Cockatoo had been fed, the three of them ambled over to the elephant cage. “This is Sally,” Roger said. Then he took everyone into the room beside the cage. “Tom can you take that big container of food from the fridge.” Tom shook his head. “I’m not carrying that, it weighs a ton,” “I’ll do it,” said Cindy. The container wobbled in her hands for a moment, but then she was able to hold it steady. “This is going to give me strong muscles for sure.” Henry reached inside the fridge to get the elephant’s desert -- a cantaloupe but it dropped onto the ground. As he picked it up, his body started to quiver. “I’m sorry, please don’t yell.” “Don’t worry so much Henry. Everything is okay.” Cindy handed the food container to Roger and Henry gave him the cantaloupe. Roger and the students then entered the elephants feeding area. “I think elephants are the stupidest animals,” said Tom. “They have that ridiculous trunk and a real dumb expression on their face.” “Actually, they’re very smart,” said Cindy. “They’re the only animal that mourns when one of the other elephants dies.” Roger nodded. “Yes, you’re right once again Cindy. You must study a lot.” “I love animals and like to know everything about them.” Once the elephants were fed, Roger and the three students walked over to the chimpanzee area. “This is Harriet and Charlie,” Roger said as he led the students into the room beside the cage. Then Roger had Henry remove the plate of food from the fridge. This time, Henry didn’t drop a thing. “Good Work, Henry.” “Thanks.” Roger was about to take the plate into the feeding area when he remembered his hat. He was worried that one of the chimps might take it. He didn’t want to lose another hat so he put it on the top of the fridge. Then he took the plate from Henry and went into the feeding area with the students. Harriet had been swinging on a small trapeze in the cage. But when she spotted Roger she raced over to him, still wearing his hat.” Tom shook his head. “I bet she doesn’t have a brain in her head.” “You’re wrong,” said Cindy. “Chimpanzee’s are the only animals that can make tools.” Tom started to laugh. “Tools? What’s he do, make a hammer?” “No, they sharpen sticks so that they can get the ants out of the dirt and eat them.” “That’s disgusting.” Cindy turned to look at Charlie. “He looks so sad. I think he’s upset that he doesn’t have a hat like Harriet.” As soon as they exited the feeding area, Roger felt a tap on his shoulder. It was Leonard. “Hey Len. Everyone this is Leonard. He’s another zoo keeper.” All the students said hi except Tom, who looked at his watch. “Hey it’s three thirty. Are we going to be finished soon?” “Yeah, I think that’s it for today.” Roger went to get the hat that he’d left on the fridge. But it wasn’t there. Suddenly, he heard screams of laughter from Leonard and the students. When he looked back at the monkey cage, he saw the two chimps holding hands and both wearing cowboy hats. He had to giggle, but at the same time he needed to know who had done it -- one of the students or Leonard. If it was Leonard that was one thing, but if it was one of the kids...well Roger didn’t want to hire someone who was another practical joker. One was enough. “So anyone want to tell me who put my hat in the monkey cage?” Who put the hat in the monkey cage?",

        "question": "I was sleeping the little sleep – napping – when a tall, blonde ankled into my office. “Well, my lunch was stolen again today!” he bleated, planting his slender hands on his slender hips, staring petulantly down at me. “Second time this week!” I pawed sand out of my eyes, cursing the casual office attire policy that allowed men to wear shorts at work. “What’d ya want me to do about it?” I gritted, shuffling some blank papers around on my desk like I was busy. Andreas Scolari, our one-man accounts payable department, huffed, “I expect you to find out who the thief is. You are the office manager, aren’t you?” I didn’t like people telling me my job (after all, it was spelled out in big black letters on my door). “Yeah, Skip Trace, office manager,” I growled, “that’s me. Don’t sweat it, Andreas, I’ll track down the chowhound who put the bite on your lunch.” At least I’d have something to sink my teeth into for the rest of the day. After getting the details on his missing food, I gave Andreas a five-dollar chit out of petty cash, good for a crust of bread and a glass of water down at the soup kitchen two blocks over. Then I put my dogs into motion, cornering Beryl Hives at her reception desk out front. Beryl was 63 going on 200. She had a smoky voice and a smoky pair of eyes -- courtesy of way too many cigarettes. She had a chip on her shoulder the size of her beehive hairdo. But she knew the goings-on in our small business office like nobody else. “Who’s been in the office this morning, Beryl?” I jawed, leaning up against her elevated countertop. I knew that Andreas Scolari had gotten into work at 9:00 a.m., and that his lunch break start-time had been 1:00 p.m. So his brown bagger must’ve been lifted from the company breakroom fridge sometime between those two times. An egg salad sandwich, an apple, an orange and a milk chocolate bar. “Pete, Dawn, Andreas, and Konrad,” Beryl rasped in reply to my question. “And you. Why?” “Andreas lost his lunch again today,” I yammered. She hacked out a laugh, phlegmy-like. “At least I won’t have to listen to him chomping on those apples of his, then. You can hear him crunching away in the lunchroom all the way up here!” “Yeah, life’s tough,” I agreed, sweet-talking the old lady. “But you know what they say, an apple a day-” I choked on my quote when I saw Beryl stick two of her nicotine-stained fingers into her mouth to rattle her falsies around. “Dentures can’t take ‘em – too hard,” she informed me. I barely kept my lunch down. And I hadn’t even eaten yet. “When’d you chow down?” I wheezed. “I had a half a pack of Camels outside at my usual time – noon to 1:00.” Armed with the list of names Beryl had provided, I trundled away from the reception area and down the hall, crowded up behind Pete Stampkowski at the snack machine. The plus-sized salesman was overindulging one of his many weaknesses again – junk food. “Had lunch yet, big guy?” I mouthed. He yanked the sisters Sweet Marie and Baby Ruth out of the bottom of the machine and straightened up with an ‘oof’. A grin split his heavy jowls. “Hey, Skip! Lunch? Yeah, sure, just got back – wining and dining Larry Kolger of LK Industries. We went to the Weiner Hut on Broadway. You been there lately? They got a-” “What time did you inhale the foot-longs and fries?” I interrupted, fingering the fresh mustard and gravy stains on the guy’s shirt. The last time Pete Stampkowski had eaten anything healthy was the time he’d scarfed down a bagful of Styrofoam packing worms, thinking they were white-cheese doodles. “Oh, we were there from around 11:45 ‘til now, I guess. I just got back. Say, you wanna hear something funny-” I left Pete to swallow his longwinded story, slipping past him and through the side door, out into the sunshine. I spotted Dawn de Jong stretching her legs, and I briefly shadowed her. Then flat-out ran to catch up with the well-toned payroll clerk striding down the sidewalk pumping her arms and legs. “Another walking lunch, sugar?” I puffed. “You know I never eat lunch, Skip,” she said, barely breathing hard. “I have all the fruits and nuts and water I need at my desk at work.” She turned her head and shone her violet eyes on me, smiling. I went weak in the knees. The shin splints I got all on my own. “How ‘bout making with the milk of human kindness and going out with me some time?” I gasped. She quickened her pace, leaving me in the dust. “Sorry,” she tossed over her shoulder, “but I’m lactose intolerant.” I collected my thoughts, and breath, and shouldered my way back into the office. I set up shop in the conference room, picked up the phone, punched up Konrad Pushkin’s cubicle. “Konrad, it’s your wife!” I warbled in my best falsetto. Imitations were one of my specialties, and I’d met Konrad’s distinctively high-pitched wife at last year’s Christmas party. “Yeah?” came the exasperated reply. Konrad was the company’s accounts receivable collector, a dour, hard-faced man with an attitude as stony as the Kremlin. And with good reason – he had seven children at home, and a job that barely put enough food in everyone’s mouth. “I need you to stop at the market on your way home and pick up a few hundred items!” I shrilled. He grunted, “I already gave you the food money for the week. There ain’t anymore!” I set the trap. “Weeell … can’t you maybe take up a collection at work – of food? There must be some lying around in the-” The trap snapped back in my face, the sharp clicking sound of Konrad angrily cutting the line leaving me speechless. For all his flinty faults, the guy did have a reputation for honesty and integrity. I ambled back outside to mull things over. But the hot summer sun didn’t burn off the fog surrounding my brain. Until I wandered into the parking lot out back and leaned up against the dumpster, and my nose started twitching. That’s when I knew it was time to get dirty. Before this case ate me up. So, I followed my beak, right over the side and into the bungalow-sized garbage container. And after only a few minutes of smelly sifting, I found what I was searching for: A brown paper bag containing a collection of bread crusts, a shiny red apple, a fistful of orange peels and one very empty milk chocolate bar wrapper. Evidence! I climbed out of the dumpster with my haul and tumbled to the pavement. Triumphantly! Knowing that I’d have the food burglar regurgitating a confession in no time. Who stole the food?",

        "question": "Mr. Womback arrived at his biology classroom at 8:00 am, as usual. Waiting for him in the hallway was Matilda Robbens, one of his eleventh grade students. She was carrying a red and white plastic cooler, the kind you pack picnic lunches in. Only, this cooler seemed to be shaking, all on its own. “I got your frogs, Mr. Womback!” the freckle-faced tomboy yelped, holding up the agitated cooler. “Finally! Thirty frogs, like you wanted.” “Good,” Mr. Womback responded. He unlocked the door to his classroom, flicked on the lights and walked inside. Then he unlocked the door to the storage room behind his front desk. Matilda trailed after him with her jumpy cooler. “Here, put it on the counter, Matilda, next to the aquarium,” Mr. Womback instructed. The girl set the cooler down on the black counter that ran the length of the narrow room, next to a large, empty aquarium. “It took me two whole weeks to catch all of them, Mr. Womback. Like you’ve taught us in class, the frog populations are way down, and I had a really hard time finding all you wanted. Really hard!” “Five dollars a piece, Matilda,” Mr. Womback intoned, opening up the cooler and looking down at thirty healthy green and brown leopard frogs. “As we agreed.” One of the amphibians leaped up and almost hit the man in the nose, and Mr. Womback began transferring the rambunctious hoppers from the cooler to the aquarium. “Ten dollars each,” Matilda countered. Just then Kyle Kravetsky, the science department’s student lab assistant, stuck his head in the doorway. “Here, Kyle,” Mr. Womback said, “help me get these frogs into the aquarium.” “Not a chance, Teach,” Kyle grimaced, watching with distaste as a large green spotted specimen wriggled out of Mr. Womback’s hands and hit the counter hopping. “I’m not touching those slimy reptiles. Snakes, either. You don’t pay me enough for that.” Mr. Womback snorted, grabbing up the rogue frog and squirting it into the aquarium. “Speaking of pay …” Matilda reminded him. “I’m sorry, Matilda. Five dollars per frog is all I have in the budget. I’ll get a check made up that you can pick up in class this afternoon.” It was Matilda’s turn to snort, as she stomped out of the classroom. “Speaking of checks, Mr. W, you think you can advance me my hundred dollars for this week?” Kyle asked. “See, I’ve got a date with-” “You know you left the doors unlocked the other night?” Mr. Womback interrupted, turning on the thin, straw-haired teenager. “Sergio Ramos, the night custodian, informed me that when he came to clean the rooms at 6:00 pm Monday night, both doors were unlocked. I’ve warned you about that before, Kyle. With a key, comes responsibility. We have expensive equipment and toxic chemicals” “Yeah, yeah, sorry about that, Mr. W. Won’t happen again. Now, about that advance …” “See you in class this afternoon,” Mr. Womback dismissed the boy, as he bobbled the last of the squirming frogs into the aquarium. When the biology teacher held up a frog to his eleventh grade class later that afternoon, he announced that they would be dissecting them during Friday’s class. A mixture of cheering and eewing went up, along with Marnie Pepper’s hand. “I protest putting these innocent frogs to death, Mr. Womback!” the small, redheaded bundle of energy stated. As a self-described ‘animal activist’, the girl was concerned with the welfare and ethical treatment of all creatures, amphibious or otherwise. “So noted,” Mr. Womback sighed. “Just like with the worms, Marnie, you can leave the classroom and study a dissection on the computer, while the real dissections are taking place.” Marnie folded her arms over her chest and further declared, “I want it on record that the use of animals for experimental purposes is-” “So noted!” Mr. Womback declared back, sticking the wriggling frog into the pocket of his lab coat. A half hour after class concluded at 3:30, as Mr. Womback was locking his classroom door, he caught Sergio Ramos sauntering down the hallway. “I hope you do a better job of cleaning my class and storage rooms than you did last night, Sergio. Half of the wastepaper baskets weren’t even emptied and some of the lab tables weren’t wiped down. Not to mention, you broke another jar of calf brains.” The lanky janitor glanced angrily around at the students snickering at him getting chewed out by Mr. Womback. “Hey, man,” he said, trying to act cool, “I just came to watch the volleyball game. I’m not on the clock ‘til six, you know.” Mr. Womback grunted. Then he joined the large body of students and teachers heading towards the gymnasium to watch the girls’ volleyball team take on the school’s cross-town rival. Marnie Pepper turned out to be the star of the game, her parents and a crowd of cheering admirers sweeping her and the rest of the team out of the school for a victory party at a local pizzeria right after the game ended at 6:00. Sergio Ramos locked the doors to the school shortly thereafter. Mr. Womback’s first clue that something was wrong the next morning was when he spotted two frogs sitting in a puddle in the teachers’ parking lot. They eyed him suspiciously, and he eyed them. His second clue was when he found both the door to his classroom and his storage room unlocked. His final clue was when he saw the aquarium sitting empty, the window above it slightly ajar. “Morning, Teach,” Kyle Kravetsky said, strolling into the storage room. “Hey, where are all the croakers?” Mr. Womback gritted his teeth. “Apparently, they somehow escaped through a closed window sometime after I left the classroom – locked! – at 4:00 pm yesterday afternoon. Kyle!?” As the teenager blushed redder than a Panamanian poison frog, Matilda Robbens popped her head into the room. “What’s going on? Hey, where’d all the frogs go?” “They were here when I restocked those test tubes around five o’clock like you asked, Mr. W.” Kyle gulped. “I left a little while after that to refill Mr. Ludwig’s Bunsen burners in the chemistry lab. I, uh, think … I locked the doors.” Mr. Womback simmered like pan-fried frogs’ legs, staring at the boy. “Don’t worry, Mr. Womback,” Matilda piped up, “I can get some frogs pretty quick – for a price.” Mr. Womback barged past his two students and out into the classroom proper. His glaring eyes took in the overflowing wastepaper baskets and the puddles of formaldehyde on the lab tables. “Looks like Ramos didn’t even bother cleaning my classroom at all last night!” he growled. Then the irate biology teacher’s blood pressure dropped like a frog’s in winter mud hibernation, as he suddenly realized what happened. “I think I know who let the frogs out,” he hypothesized. Who let the frogs out?",

        "question": "It was 8:35 A.M. and Cynthia Peck was not only in a bad mood but late for work as well, which was most unusual for her. Not only was she late, but rain had been coming down in a torrential downpour since 7:13. She knew it was 7:13 because that is what the digital clock in her automobile reflected as the first thick raindrops splattered her windshield. As she entered the Ames building, she cursed silently that her oversized umbrella had done a poor job of keeping her dry. But, today, it was probably good that she was late, for it could possibly be herself that her administrative assistant, Megan Brewer, found dead on the floor of her spacious office. Cynthia Peck was 37 years old and a vice president of the Ames Marketing Company. She did not become a company vice president by being weak or faint hearted. She knew something was wrong as she exited the sixth floor elevator and met several uniformed police officers waiting for her to arrive. Before the officers had a chance to say anything to her, she asked, “What is going on?” Detective Sergeant Kyle Whitmore answered, “Are you Cynthia Peck?” “Yes,’ she replied and asked again, “What’s going on?” “There is a dead man in your office. Your assistant, Ms. Brewer, found him this morning. Identification in his wallet shows him to be Mr. Trent Willis. Do you know him?” Cynthia showed no emotion as she answered, “Yes, we had a meeting in my office scheduled for this morning. What happened?” “He was murdered,” the detective answered, watching Cynthia carefully, and added, “he has a letter opener in his chest. The only belongings we found were his cell phone and briefcase.” The detective did not share with her the fact that the state of her office indicated the powerfully built Willis, whose driver’s license showed him to be 35 years old, put up a violent but futile struggle with his attacker. Cynthia now felt a slight dizziness. Small beads of perspiration broke out upon her high forehead as she asked, without visible emotion, “Who did it?” “We don’t know yet,” Sergeant Whitmore answered, noticing the wetness on Cynthia’s clothing. He pointed towards the end of the hall and said, “Please join us in the conference room after taking a moment to dry off.” “Thank you,” she gratefully replied. Upon entering the conference room, Cynthia saw that her assistant, Megan Brewer, was already seated along with her boss, company president Steve Ledbetter and a member of her marketing team, Josh Kesler. She quickly took a seat and noted that a uniformed policeman stood at the door. Anyone wishing to enter or exit the room would have to do so through the officer. The four Ames employees looked expectantly at Sergeant Whitmore. Whitmore silently noted to himself that the Ames employees, with the exception of Steve Ledbetter, appeared to be between 35-40 years old and in good physical condition. President Ledbetter was the exception, being 58 years old and at least 50 pounds overweight. He began to speak, “Ms. Brewer found the victim at 7:51 this morning. Mr. Willis, as you know, Ms. Peck, had an 8:15 appointment to see you. Ms. Brewer claims not to know how he got to the sixth floor and into the office. I know that I do not need to tell you that the stairways are locked and a pass code is needed to exit the elevator on the sixth floor. Now, Ms. Peck and Ms. Brewer are the only persons with a passkey into Ms. Peck’s office, but Ms. Brewer informs us that she left her passkey on her outer office desk for a few moments while in the break room getting a cup of coffee. Security tells us that four persons accessed the sixth floor before 7:51.” Whitmore stopped for a moment to catch his breath and, with a sweeping motion of his hand, added, “And those persons are all of you. Before anyone asks, records show Ms. Peck exited the elevator at 6:45, a little over an hour before Mr. Trent was discovered.” “It’s true, Sergeant. Stupidly, I left the signed contract I was to give to Mr. Willis at home. I had to return home and get it.” The sergeant looked at Cynthia and said, “OK, for now. What security shows is that Ms. Peck arrived at 6:45, and Ms. Brewer was next at 6:59. At 7:25, Mr. Kesler arrived. Mr. Ledbetter was last to arrive at 7:40.” Sgt. Whitmore paused and looked at each of them in turn before adding, “It’s highly unlikely that somebody hid overnight on the sixth floor, but we’re checking security cameras as I speak. What is much more likely is that one of you murdered Trent Willis.” Megan felt faint and began to weep. Softly, Sgt. Whitmore said to her, “I’m sorry, Ms. Brewer, this is unpleasant but necessary. Steve Ledbetter asked, “Why not check the cameras to see when Mr. Willis entered?” “Because lightning knocked them out early this morning, before the rains hit,” was the sergeant’s reply. Turning to Cynthia, he said, “Let’s begin with you, Ms. Peck. You first arrived at 6:45. Did you enter your office?” “Yes. It was then that I discovered that I left the contract at home. I left to retrieve it.” “Security shows you left the sixth floor at 6:49,” Whitmore noted, “That’s right,” Cynthia answered. “So it took you an hour and 46 minutes to get back here?” Whitmore asked. “Right again. The rain hit at 7:13 by my car radio and traffic crawled to a stop. I was in my car the entire time, except for the short time I was in my apartment retrieving the contract.” Cynthia thought for a moment as Whitmore’s eyes bored into her and then added, “I made several cell phone calls from my car, one of them around 7:10 to the newspaper delivery service, one to my husband’s office around 7:35 and another just after 8:00 to my doctor’s office. Telephone company records will show my cell phone to be a long way from here between shortly after leaving until after 8:15 or so.” As she said this, she handed Sgt. Whitmore her cell phone. Whitmore thanked her and turned to Cynthia’s assistant, Megan Brewer, who had composed herself. He stated, “You exited the elevator at 6:59. Did you notice anything out of the ordinary when you arrived?” “Nothing. I noticed the lightning outside the windows but that is all.” Thinking for a moment, he asked, “Did Ms. Peck call you at anytime after leaving to return home? “No, but that is not unusual. She only calls when she needs to. This morning, she sent an email before leaving, explaining the situation and asking me to make Mr. Willis comfortable.” Whitmore turned to Josh Kesler and asked, “What about you? You got here at 7:25. Did you see or hear anything out of the ordinary?” “No,” was his response. Did you make any calls on your cell phone or from the office; anything that can prove you are not the killer?” Nervously, Josh replied, “No, nothing.” Whitmore thought for a long moment, and then asked Steve Ledbetter. “Do you have a raincoat?” “Yes, but I do not have it with me. As president of the company, I have a car and driver at my disposal. Maurice always lets me out right at the front door so I never wear a coat.” Turning back to Josh Kesler, “And you? Do you have a raincoat?” Josh was puzzled but answered, “No, but I have an umbrella. If you want to see it, it’s drying in my office.” Sergeant Whitmore had seen a lot in his 12 years as a homicide investigator, but never anything as bizarre as this. Pointing to the murderer, he said to the officer guarding the door, “Arrest this person for second degree murder.” Who is the murderer?",

        "question": "Who did this? I asked myself, not believing what was in front of me. I had arrived at my psychology office at ten this morning, as usual. Then, I walked across the road to the local coffee shop, had a latte and half an hour later headed back to the office. That’s when I saw my slashed tires. I was shocked! The fact that four tires had been cut instead of just one indicated that it wasn’t just a prank by some kids in the neighborhood. It was obviously done by someone who had issues with me. Immediately, I narrowed it down to four possibilities. They were my “red-zone” patients -- ones that I had not yet been able to help. I dashed into my office, dug up their files and asked my secretary, Renata, to try and schedule all of them for today. Then I had her phone the Auto Club about my car. I decided I would speak to each of the patients and attempt to figure out the culprit. However, I knew that I couldn’t merely ask them about the incident -- some might react badly. I would have to watch for subtle clues. I only had to wait a few moments before Renata buzzed to let me know that Mrs. Roberts had arrived. The door to my office opened and in she trotted. She was blonde and weighed far too much for her small frame. We had been trying to discover the psychological reasons for her compulsive over-eating but so far no luck. “Hello, Mrs. Roberts, how’s everything going?” “Not very well,” she said, pointing a chubby finger at me. “Your suggestions don’t seem to work at all.” “I see. You blame me?” “You know what I’ve lost so far? Three pounds. I still can’t bend down to kiss my kids. How am I going to go to that wedding next week looking like this?” “Mrs. Roberts, rather than being so upset, you should congratulate yourself on your success.” She grimaced. “What success? It’s only three pounds.” “Yes that’s true. But many of my patients would be thrilled they lost anything. Most of them are gaining by the week.” She paused for a moment, seemed to be thinking that over. Suddenly, she sat up a little straighter in her chair, her pale face gaining a bit of color. She seemed a bit more optimistic now and we continued talking about her weight until her hour was up. Then I asked Renata to send in the next patient. Randy Peters stumbled in and cautiously walked towards the chair in front of my desk. “What’s wrong Mr. Peters?” “Lost my contacts, doc. Don’t know where I put them.” He felt for the chair and sat down. “Be careful, Mr. Peters. That’s dangerous.” “Yes, I know. I’m taking a taxi home.” “Good.” I nodded. “I was curious how everything is going?” “Not very well.” “You told me last week that you were having more frequent dreams.” He nodded. “Yesterday was the worst. The man in the mask chased me down the street. But I finally stood up to him and ripped his mask off.” “Was the face familiar to you?” “Now that you mention it he may have looked a bit like you, doc.” “Like me? What do you think that means?” He shrugged. “I don’t know. But it upset me a great deal to see you staring at me.” He gestured with his hand and knocked over my penholder. “Sorry doc.” He quickly picked up all the pens and dropped them back into the holder. Suddenly, he smiled. “I got it, Doc. You remind me of my dad and I never got along with him. That’s why I must have gotten upset when I saw you in the dream.” I was happy we had made some progress in his therapy. We continued talking more about his father until it was time for my next patient. Mr. Carlson entered my office and grimaced as he looked down at the chair in front of him. “Is it okay if I stand doctor?” “Yes, that’s fine.” Mr. Carlson had a phobia about germs and it seemed to be getting worse. “How are things going?” “Not well. Today, I couldn’t even touch my computer at work.” “Did you try the affirmations like we did with some of your other obsessions?” “It didn’t do any good. In fact, I got so upset, I wanted to take it out on somebody.” He stared at me. “Did anything unusual happen to you the week before this started?” He started to lean against the wall, but then looked at it and moved away. “Well last week, I accidentally locked myself in the garage. It was very messy and I was stuck there for hours.” I smiled. “We may have hit on something, Mr. Carlson. We continued to talk about his issues and I finally got him to sit in the chair. At the end of the session, Renata sent in my last “red-zone” patient. Mr. Leamington ambled in smoking a cigarette, even though the reason he had come to see me originally was that he wanted to quit smoking. “I thought we agreed that you wouldn’t smoke in here, Mr. Leamington.” “I’m sorry,” He said. “It’s just I couldn’t control myself. It seems as if my hands have a mind of their own. I understand,” I said. “What thought comes into your mind, just before you pull out the cigarette?” “Nothing, doctor.” “I know you think there’s nothing. But every action has a thought that precedes it. Okay, what time did you start smoking this morning?” “I started as soon as I got up -- about twelve. I do shift-work.” “Okay, now go back in your mind. You have just awoken. What are you thinking?” He closed his eyes for a moment then opened them quickly. “I’m thinking about my girlfriend dumping me. It made me mad.” “So perhaps you felt that the cigarette would help you feel better. Is that correct?” He thought again. “Yes, I think you’re right.” “Good work, I think we’re onto something.” He smiled broadly. I gave Mr. Leamington some other tactics he could try then ended the session. After he left, I tried to figure out which of my patients had slashed my tires. Who slashed the tires?",

        "question": "245 West 11th was a brick building. Its green door was adorned with a small bronze plaque reading, “Private Investigator.” Bill Buchanan nodded to his associates and returned the business card to his pocket. He knocked eagerly. “Come in,” answered him.\n\tBuchanan held the door and followed the three other men down the skinny hallway to the office of the detective. The room was neat but crowded. A desk sat in the middle, and the detective behind it. On the desk, among various papers, was a dust-covered magnifying glass. An unfinished game of chess was set on a board in the far corner. Next to it was an unimposing alcohol cabinet, each bottle still full. The back wall was covered by a large bookshelf. The books looked as untouched as the whisky. Upon his guests' entrance, the detective moved from the desk to an armchair by the room's lone window. Beethoven played softly through the door to the bedroom. “Mr. Tom Haven, remember me?” said Buchanan. “We met at Wilfie's bar? You told me about your case involving the petrified maid.” “It's Bill, right? The professor?” Haven asked. He stood and they shook hands. “Yes. You impressed me so much I wanted to see you work in person. So when this gentleman's wallet went missing at the cafe just a few blocks down, I told everyone we have to come and let you solve the mystery.” “Would anyone like a drink?” Haven asked. They all told him, “No, thanks.” “Whose wallet is missing?” “Mine,” said Carson Thomson, the eldest of the group. He looked about sixty, with thin white hair and wrinkled skin. He was short and frail. “What happened, Bill?” Haven asked. “I was getting lunch with my friend David Nader,” Buchanan began. He indicated the tallest man in the room. David was a tan man with a thin face. “The only other people there were Mr. Thomson, the owner of the restaurant: Mr. Garcia,” Vincent Garcia's slow nod bordered on a bow. He wore a thin black mustache and an imperfect toupee. “And Cooper, the waiter, who Mr. Garcia wouldn't let accompany us.” “It is a business after all,” said Garcia. “The cook is there to keep him company anyway.” “What did you order?” “I had a chicken pesto sandwich,” said Buchanan. “I had already eaten, so I just had coffee,” said Nader. “I had a sirloin steak,” said Thomson. “When did you notice your wallet was missing Mr. Thomson?” Haven asked. “I had payed and laid down a dollar-twenty tip,” said Thomson. “And I left. I tried to purchase a newspaper from a stand down the block; that's when I noticed I had forgotten my wallet. When I went back it was gone.” “Did either of you notice his wallet on the table?” Haven asked. “They must have seen it, their table was right next to mine! Within an arm's reach,” said Thomson. “I certainly didn't,” said Buchanan. “Neither did I,” said Nader. “We were having a very interesting conversation on the economy.” “We were just standing up to leave when Mr. Thomson accused us of the theft,” said Buchanan. “Then the waiter came with our receipts and Thomson accused him as well.” “Then,” elaborated Nader, “he went to the kitchen and alerted Mr. Garcia here.” “Well it had to be one of you,” said Thomson.\n\t\n\tHaven observed each suspect closely. Bill Buchanan had brown, well-combed hair, a sharp nose and dark brown eyes. He leaned to his left on a black cane with a silver, L-shaped handle. He wore a navy suit with a light pink tie on a white shirt. The shirt had a small green stain near his belt, which was black with a silver clasp to match his penny loafers. His right hand cradled two large hard cover economics books like a football—each book held several scrap-paper bookmarks. He had a gold pen sticking out of his suit's breast pocket. David Nader was at least two inches taller. He had green eyes. He wore a lintless grey tweed sport coat over a light blue shirt with no tie. His pants were dark green. His brown dress shoes, though well polished, were very worn. He had a gold watch on his right wrist, and held a dark grey fedora in his left hand. On his coat's left wrist there were chalk smudges and half a leaf stuck to one of his buttons. Vincent Garcia was wearing a simple outfit. A white shirt with a black tie over black slacks and shoes. The tie was tucked into his belt, and the shirt pocket held a notebook. A pencil rested behind his left ear, which pushed his toupee slightly off center. He had dark bags under beady eyes. A stained white cloth peeked out of his left hip pocket. His shoes were very scuffed at the toes but looked otherwise new. He had cuts on two knuckles on his left hand. Carson Thomson wore thick-rimmed glasses over pale blue eyes. He wore a brown suit a size too big. He had a white oxford shirt and no tie. His pants ended prematurely, exposing brown argyle socks, which entered brown wingtips. Each shoelace looked to be at least triple-knotted. He gripped a grey corduroy bucket style hat with both hands. He had a pair of glasses sticking out of the breast pocket of his coat. He wore a wedding ring, and had a silver Rolex on his left wrist. “Can I look at those books?” Haven asked Buchanan. Buchanan obliged. Haven opened the first to a bookmarked page. At the top a Marx quote was circled. It read, “All people are born alike—except Republicans and Democrats.” “Do you want to search us?” Buchanan asked. “Would anyone object?” Buchanan shook his head, and Nader and Garcia were willing, but Thomson took exception. “Why would you search the man who lost the wallet?” “Don't worry,” Haven said. “It won't be necessary.” “You want to check out the restaurant?” asked Garcia. “No, that's alright. I now know not only who took the wallet, but where it's hidden.” He paused for dramatic effect. Who stole the wallet?",

        "question": "\"I'm proud of my dog,\" said Mark. \"Macca's my dog too!\" shouted Taylor. Mark and Taylor lived with their parents on a farm near the woods. Mark had gotten a puppy for his birthday two years ago, and now the puppy had grown into a proud-looking Husky. Mark agreed to let his younger sister Taylor help look after the dog, but Mark still always thought of Macca as belonging just to him. \"Macca likes everybody,\" Mark said. \"He likes me more!\" Taylor teased. Macca barked. \"He's agreeing with me!\" squealed Taylor. \"He is not,\" Mark laughed. But he was glad to have something to argue about, since it took his mind off the wintry cold. Dad had sent them down the driveway to pick up today's mail -- but their driveway was over a quarter of a mile long, and it was covered with snow. It ran between two fields where they'd grow strawberries in the spring, but now even those were also covered with snow. For the long, cold trip to the mail box, Mark and Taylor had brought Macca along to keep them company. Suddenly they saw an enormous paw print in the snow ahead of them. It had five toes -- like a person -- but each one ended with a sharp claw. \"It's huge!\" shouted Taylor. \"It's six inches long at least!\" Mark hurried to look around for the creature that made it, but all he saw was the afternoon sunlight on the snow, and bare tree trunks at the edge of the field. A trail of paw prints led off into the trees which grew thicker further up the hill, forming the beginning of a wide forest. \"Come on!\" said Taylor. \"Let's follow the paw prints.\" \"Let's not,\" said Mark. He knew what creature to which the paw prints belonged. \"It's Old Mugger.\" \"Who's Old Mugger?\" asked Taylor. Old Mugger was a giant black bear. Late one night last summer, the bear had surprised everybody -- including the farmers -- by making an unexpected attack from the forest. The bear started clawing a horse on the nearby farm, but the horse quickly galloped away. The clever horse had survived, but the next morning when the farmer woke up, he'd seen a trail of fierce claw marks running down the horse's side. Mark had seen the claw marks too -- and he'd known right then that he never wanted to meet Old Mugger the bear. There was more bad news that afternoon. After all that walking, Mark and Taylor discovered that their mailbox was empty. They'd walked a long way for nothing. As they headed back down the driveway, Mark wondered if that bear was still around. And then Macca suddenly started barking at something behind them. Had he seen the bear? Mark turned quickly to look, but it was just a truck coming up the road. Then he recognized the truck, and shouted excitedly to Taylor. \"It's the mailman! Maybe we'll get some mail after all!\" Taylor sighed loudly to show that she didn't want to walk back to the mailbox, and then said \"We have the fattest mailman ever.\" \"That's not polite,\" said Mark. \"But it's true,\" Taylor said smugly. Mark and Taylor watched as Orville, their mailman, struggled to gather up the mail in his truck. His truck tilted as Orville reached over for the magazines he was delivering, and then it tilted back the other way as he straightened up and stepped out its door. But then the magazines went flying into the air as Orville slipped and fell into the snow. \"Oof!\" said Orville, as his body plopped into a white snow drift. And magazines landed gently all around him. Taylor ran to pick up the magazines out of the snow. \"Thanks,\" said Orville. \"Dad doesn't like it when his magazines get wet,\" Taylor said, ignoring Orville altogether. She quickly scooped up all the magazines, then began running back to the house. Mark picked up two more letters that had fallen into the snow, as Orville stood up without saying anything, brushing the chunks of snow off his trousers. Then he noticed Mark's dog. \"His name's Macca,\" Mark said. \"Don't worry, he won't bite you.\" Macca barked playfully. \"Mailmen always worry about getting bitten by dogs,\" Orville said warily. \"Especially me -- I'm terrified of dogs, because I'm too fat to outrun them!\" Mark laughed, and said \"Don't worry. My dog's very well behaved -- and he's a purebred!\" Orville still had chunks of snow in his hair, but he tossed his head and looked strangely at the dog. \"Is that right?\" said Orville. \"My brother breeds dogs. He sells them to rich people who are looking for the purest breed of a dog. I bet your dog would be worth a lot of money!\" Mark laughed, but then realized that the mailman wasn't making a joke. \"My dog's not for sale!\" Mark said. Orville didn't say anything back. There was an awkward silence. Mark checked the ground for any more letters that their mailman had dropped, but Orville was already revving up the engine on his mail truck. Before Mark could say anything, Orville was already driving away down the road. *\t\t\t*\t\t\t* Back at the house, Mark told his father that he and Tina had seen been bear tracks in the snow. Mark's father looked worried, and his mother tried to change the subject. \"We need to take Macca to the vet soon for his annual check up!\" she said casually. But it didn't work. Mark was still worried about the bear. After dinner that night, Mark let Macca out into their back yard. \"I wouldn't sell you for a million dollars,\" he told his dog -- and Macca barked once, wagging his tail happily. The weather was unpredictable, and an inch of snow had already piled up on the tall fence that ran around their yard, so Mark was glad that Macca had a warm doghouse to sleep in. But that night, Mark had a nightmare. Macca was lost on their farm, and no matter how hard Mark looked, he couldn't find his beloved dog anywhere. Mark tried calling out for Macca in the night, but then he flopped down into a big drift of snow -- just like Orville their mailman had done that afternoon. In the dream, Mark's sister Taylor skipped up and stole all the mail out of Mark's hands. When Mark woke up that morning, he was in a frustrated mood. He leaped out of bed and went straight to the backyard to say hi to Macca. But Macca was gone. It had snowed in the night -- there were now two inches of snow along the fence around the yard. All sounds seemed to be muffled by the snow, filling the yard with a strange silence. An empty winter wind blew across the sunny sky. But there was no sign of Macca. \"Macca's missing!\" Mark said. \"Maybe a bear ate him,\" said Taylor. She was already awake, wearing a short-sleeved t-shirt that said, \"I WILL be seen and I WILL be heard.\" She'd come out of her room to see why Mark was upset. \"A bear did not eat my dog!\" Mark said angrily. But he ran out into the front yard to look for clues. All he saw was snow -- the driveway was completely covered with a smooth blanket, and it muffled all the sounds, making everything seem dangerously quiet. It was just like his nightmare last night... Suddenly Mark heard his dad's voice, shouting out from the house. \"It's too cold for you to be running around outside!\" \"But Dad!\" Mark shouted back. \"At least let me get your jackets out of your rooms.\" \"Dad!\" Mark said insistently. \"We need to talk to you!\" \"And I'm warm enough already,\" shouted Taylor. As they walked back to the house, Taylor asked \"Do you think mom just took Macca to the vet this morning?\" \"Or maybe Orville the mailman stole him,\" Mark said. \"He has a brother that sells dogs to rich people.\" But by the time they reached the house, Mark had suddenly put all the clues together. He turned to his father and said, \"Macca's gone from the back yard. And I know who's responsible!\" Who stole the dog?",

        "question": "Lt. Commander Cecelia Holman was jolted awake by the screech of the security siren. She leapt out of her bunk, donned her skinsuit, dashed down the corridor and was in the station security office in 15 minutes flat. “Report, Sergeant,” she ordered as she slipped into her command chair. “Ma'am! Engineering reports a security breach in the shield generator compartment. Shield status has gone from standby to inoperative. Fault diagnostics determined the shield structure control unit had failed. Lt. Erikson ordered the spare from stores before heading for the compartment. The Stores computer informs us the spare is no longer in inventory and Lt. Erikson has found that the SSCU hasn't failed, but has been removed, Ma'am. The security alarm was immediately activated and the station military section has been sealed.” Before Cecilia could respond, the security alarm changed to the deep tones of “Battle Stations” and her console lit with an incoming call from the station's military exec, Captain Phillips. Cecilia keyed acceptance and his craggy face appeared on the screen. “Commander, we have multiple, unscheduled hyperspace arrivals. The timing is highly suspicious. We need full shield capability. They’ll reach controlled missile range in six hours. I need you to do your Sherlock Holmes act, Holman. First priority: find one of the control units. Second: find and lock down our saboteur.\" He paused a moment, then, \"Do your best, Ceci, we're relying on you.” “Aye, aye, Skipper!” Cecelia responded. Cutting the connection, Cecilia looked at her team leaders and began issuing orders. *** Two hours later, they gathered in the security conference room to review progress. “Sergeant Benson, your team had personnel checks. Status, please?” “Ma'am, 18 personnel have the expertise to remove the SSCU without setting off security alerts. Fifteen of these have alibis for the time period in question. The remaining three are Lt. Erikson’s duty techs, Valance and Bennington, and Master Sgt. O'Hennessey. I also brought in Lt. Erikson since she missed the alert. They’re all in detention, Ma'am.” “What do we have on their backgrounds?” “Nothing indicative, Ma'am. Valance was commended for bravery when the Ravshek took Herstog. His wife and son didn't get off-planet. He hates the Ravers – not a surprise since they eat human flesh! CIT has verified the incoming ships as Ravshek, so it's unlikely he's our saboteur. “He and Bennington were working on a control shunt in corridor B32 that has been causing problems for the last four days. Both have insulation smears on hands and uniform sleeves that confirm this and Valance says Bennington was there the whole time. They’re only still suspects because both have the capability and are each others' alibi.” “The others?” “O'Hennessey is in for his fourth five-year stretch. Excellent duty ratings, but some black marks for off-duty public brawling and operating a still.” “Erikson and Bennington?” “The lieutenant was a corporal, Ma'am, sent to OTC on the recommendation of her battalion CO Major Hilton. She was 47th in her class of 100. There's nothing official, but the secured section of her personnel dossier includes a suspicion that her relationship with the Major may have breeched fraternization regulations. “Bennington's ratings indicate a so-so technical ability; it's questionable he could have removed the SSCU without setting off alarms. He has a reputation as a ladies' man.” “I see. Have Erikson, Valance and Bennington placed in an interview room together and O’Hennessey in a separate interview room.\" Cecilia turned to her next team leader. “Sergeant Devallier, civilian activity?” “We've interviewed all civilians that entered the military sector bar one, a Villiasoo trader called Scrivine. He had a meeting with the quartermaster at 0300 hours; wanted to sell some luxury foodstuffs for the officer's mess. Came in on the 'Cheeanie' seven hours ago and requested an immediate meeting on the basis of a tight shipping schedule. He had a security detail from reception to the quartermaster's and back. He left the military sector at 0324 hours. Cpl. Devon, who led the detail, says Scrivine had no unescorted access anywhere. He confirms that Valance and Bennington who were working in corridor B32 when they passed. Scrivine did chat with and give samples to some of the crew, including Valance.” “Hmmm ... the Villiasoo are supposedly neutral, but I've heard they're more 'neutral' towards the Ravshek than to us. Sgt. Billings, what have you managed to put together from the logs?” “Ma'am, the SSCU was disabled at 0346 hours. Lt. Erikson was on duty but somehow missed it at that time. She posted her inventory request for the spare at 0401, in response to the 0400 maintenance report. The 0300 to 0400 inventory log was deleted, the 0200 to 0300 log archived normally and the 0400 to 0500 log initiated normally; but whoever removed the spare SSCU must have wiped the log. Inventory status can't be manually altered; the SSCU spare was there at 0300 and gone at 0400. Total parts count was reduced by three during that period. We’ve accounted for two. The third had to be the SSCU.” “Probably. Anything else?” “The last garbicle ejection from military sector was 17 hours ago. I let Hermes know straight off, Ma'am.” “Good. Sgt. Hernandez, search status?” “Ma'am, teams are searching all compartments, but it's going to take time. With Sgt. Billings' confirmation that the garbage hasn’t been frozen and ejected I've had a team scan the compartment. No components intrinsic to SSCUs were detected.” “I want an eyeball search, please, Sergeant.” “Aye aye, Ma'am.” “And have a security tech check the repair work in B32. I want to know about anything even minutely unusual.” *** Cecelia was at her workstation, reviewing video feeds from the brig. O'Hennessey had a visitor, a security sergeant who shouldn’t be there. She keyed the feed for sound. “...ring squad for you this time, Oh Hen-sick-be!” sneered the sergeant. “In your dreams, Bannick. With Sherlock in charge of the investigation, she'll find the saboteur, which sure as heck ain't me!” In the other room, Lieutenant Erikson was pacing while Valance and Bennington sat at the table. Erikson's uniform was immaculate until she turned round to pace the other way. Two handprints, the color of insulation foam and of a size to match Bennington’s, on her lower back marred the otherwise perfection. Cecelia’s comm buzzed. It was Sgt. Hernandez. “Ma'am, the team in the garbage disposal just found a woman's finger. It's been sent for DNA analysis. And the tech checking the repairs in B32 found two lighting controllers hidden in the insulation; they're brand new, still sealed in plastic wrap.” “Thank you, Hermes, that’s exactly what I needed to know.” Who is responsible for the sabotage?",

        "question": "It was a quiet morning in Indianapolis. But as I was enjoying coffee and listening to my wife's desperate attempts at piano, my phone rang and I was speaking to Kevin King. Kevin King was the son of a long-time friend. He was a tall but rather thin fellow and worked as Room service in the Augustus Hotel in Miami. His father had helped me through my years through very specific methods. That guy also insisted him on police work, even teaching him martial arts and all about guns. But Kevin was undisciplined. Let me summarize our conversation on the phone since his uneasiness made him talk real slow. One Banker, Roger Shelby was murdered in Augustus Hotel room 22B. His wife was shot in the back. Kevin was one of the suspects since he was in the couple's room at the time of the crime, delivering meals. \"You gotta help, Uncle Nate!\" he sounded sorry. \"I can't go to jail or in court. Dad's coming home tomorrow from his medical operation. I can't miss him in the airport.\" That didn't sound like something of dire importance, but since I don't like people wrongly accused and I don't want Old Jeff to be upset, I agreed. \"Alright, alright. Get an investigator on the line. Tell him it's me.\" \"You're not coming here?\" \"Unnecessary. Now get someone on the line and tell him it's Nathan Grant.\" He hung up and the telephone rang 20 minutes later. \"Am I speaking to Detective Grant?\" a raspy voice spoke. Yes but no. I'm retired so it's just Mr. Grant now. And don't worry you can take all the credit for this case, Mister?\" \"Bachmann. Detective. Bachmann. I can't believe its you!!! I'm a big fan of your work.\" \" Thank you then, Detective Bachmann. Please give me all details on the case.\" I sat down by our old swing in the yard and prepared my mind. \" Okay. So um... about 11:19 p.m last night, Mr. King called 911 saying Mr. Shelby shot himself and shot her wife. She is safe in the hospital now, however. The gun used was 9mm pistol with a silencer and was unlicensed. The main suspects are Dianne Shelby, Kevin King, James Castro and Mr. Shelby himself. We all suspect it suicide, sir. But Mrs. Shelby didn't believ-\" \"Hold on, detective. Let's do it from the start. Who is Mr. Shelby?\" \"He's a banker, 44 years old, muscularly built, 5 foot 5 inches, blonde, tanned, blue eyes, married to Dianne Shelby for 13 years, and they have a 12-year old son. The family came here on the 3rd of October. Mr and Mrs. Shelby stayed on 22b while their son, who insisted on having his own room, took 21c. As I said, he was shot by a 9mm silenced pistol--which had his fresh fingerprints and saliva of another man-- twice in about 11:15 pm as everyone heard it. The wounds are located just beside his right ear and he fell on his left side as if from he came from a kneeling position. His wife and the room service, Mr. King was in the room when this happened.\" \"Describe the rooms to me.\" I might have sounded cold but... \"Augustus hotel is cheap. Both rooms are exactly alike --they both have green carpet flooring, a window looking over the far beach, a few lamps, white wallpaper, a random painting above bed-- except that the couple's room have one king-size bed.\" \" Describe Mrs. Shelby, Detective Bachmann.\" \" A 5\"2 woman, 43-years old, brown hair, brown eyes, tanned skin. She admitted that she was in bad terms with her husband due to her frequent infidelity. She told us that last night, she saw him with some woman. He was apologizing, kneeling to her, when room service came. She left him kneeling and Mr. King was welcomed. A few seconds later, silenced though very audible gunshots were heard. Mrs. Shelby was shot in her back and his husband was lying dead with the pistol a few feet away from his head.\" \"You did more than describe Mrs. Shelby. But it's alright. So Mr. King saw it and called 911? And this happened in about 11:19 pm.?\" \"Yes and yes. Mr. King was in the bathroom and after peeking in the beds and seeing what happened. He silently called 911, afraid that the killer will see and hear him. \" Bachmann replied. \"Where were the Shelbys earlier that night?\" \"They were on the beach from 10 a.m. Mrs. Shelby and her son came home at 10:10 p.m as the kid was already tired. Mr. Shelby insisted for just a few more minutes, he came home at 11 p.m.\" \"And where does the Castro you spoke of fit in here? Why is he a suspect?\" \"Mr. Castro was also taking a vacation. He's 55 years in age, a retired swimming instructor and a widower. It's his first time here in Miami and he came alone. His room was 21b. He was nowhere to be found yesterday and just came to the scene at midnight last night. He looked weary and very suspicious. His saliva also happened to match the one we found on the gun.\" \"What was his alibi? What does he look like?\" \"Mr. Castro said he was just seeing the beach and he said he doesn't know how his saliva got there. Could've just been an error in the forensics' side, you know. \"He was a 6'2 man. He had frizzled hair and brown eyes. He walked in poor posture. He said he had back problems. He was wearing some generic hawaiian shirt and shorts. They looked unused, I might add. He might've bought them in some shops here,\" \"The couple's room was 22b. Which floor was that on?\" \"The third floor, sir.\" \"Were there signs that Mr. Shelby was shot at point-blank range?\" \"No, sir.\" He really should stop calling me sir. \"And both Mr. King and Mrs. Shelby didn't saw him do it even though they're so near from him?\" \"They didn't. They just heard it. Oh and in her testimony, Mr. King went to the bathroom because he can't hold his leak.\" This detective is not amazing in stating facts in an organized manner. \"But the weapon had a silencer but was still very loud, yes? And why did Mrs. Shelby believe his husband didn't do that himself?\" \" She just said she feels that something's wrong.\" \"Do the hallways cameras agree with the alibi of all suspects?\" \"Yes, sir. But we haven't checked the street cameras yet.\" \"I see. And Mrs. Shelby was right-handed?\" \"No, sir.\" \"Where was Mr. Shelby lying?\" \"Near the window.\" \"His left side was facing the bathroom door?\" \"Yes.\" After a few seconds of thought, I rose to a solution. \" I got it, Detective Bachmann. And tell the hotel to improve their security.\" Who is the murderer?",

        "question": "Sunday Morning Maria Jackson makes a double chocolate chip cake with chocolate frosting for an after dinner treat. she wakes up before her husband, Jack Jackson and he is normally up by seven a.m. for work and he does not return until either late afternoon or right before dinner. Maria makes this cake from scratch ever Sunday for her and her family, and she takes it very seriously. Her family looks forward to it every week! Her two twin sons Jimmy and Jon wake up to the smell every Sunday morning just drooling over it. They run downstairs begging their mother to just let them have a tiny bit all the time, \"Just a tiny sliver for lunch. Please Mom?\" But there is a major rule with this cake, nobody is allowed to have any of it until after dinner. So Maria tells them throughout the day no. After they hear no at least one of them say \"Fine you know what I will just steal a slice later when you aren't looking.\" The one that always says it is the mischievous son Jon. And Jimmy always responds with \"yeah right you know mom guards that cake like crazy.\" Maria will roll her eyes and say \"you know you boys are such snobs.\" Later in the day Maria tells the boys to go and get all of their chores done. Being teenage boys they groan and grunt and stomp outside and start to do their work. The only thing that motivates them is knowing that they get to have that cake today. At this point Maria normally leaves for the grocery store and tells them not to touch her cake and the boys start joking about stealing it again and Jimmy backs out of it because he knows how much trouble he would get in. \"Dude Jimmy I will be right back.\" Jon would say and Jimmy would just nod and continue to work until about 20 minutes past and he notices his brother is not back. He gets up and walks into the kitchen when he notices how close his brother is close to the freshly baked and frosted cake with a missing piece and Jon's finger covered in chocolate. \"Dude mom is going to kill you!\" Jon just stood there in shock cause he knew that his mother was going to kill somebody. Dinner time comes around and Jack walked in the door and went to the cake to check up on it when he realizes there is a piece missing from the cake. Maria walked in and saw here husband standing by the cake. \"Jack what the heck why would you eat the cake you know the number one house in the rule is to not eat this cake why would you do this?\" As she continued to yell at her husband Jimmy comes down with spot, their giant spotted Great Dane dog, yelling \"MOM Jon ate some of the cake I saw it all.\" Maria started yelling. \"Jon get down here now!\" Jon came down denying that he ate any of the cake. \"Mom I swear I did not eat any of the cake I was outside with Jimmy the only person in the house were you and spot, I came in cause I wanted lunch and a drink not to eat the cake come on mom you have got to believe me.\" Maria starred at her family \"It wasn't spot and it sure was not me, somebody did it and nobody will eat any of it until somebody confesses that they stole some of the cake and broke the rules.\" Nobody said anything so Maria continued on with her day saying \"Fine then I will eat the cake. That's fine with me.\" She went back into the kitchen to start dinner. About thirty minutes later everybody heard grunting, moaning and coughing coming form spot. Maria realized that she had forgotten to feed the dog so she threw some food in his bowl and he came running. For a second she thought that he ate some of her cake but he proved he was just a tad bit hungry. \"Mom I swear maybe spot did eat it!\" Jon bellowed. Maria just ignored her son, nobody had confessed about her cake yet so she quietly said \"dinner is done lets go.\" The family sat in silence and Maria cleared her throat and said \"since nobody wants to confess I can not find myself eating the whole cake-\" \"Mom you are going to let us eat some\" the boys cut her off. \"Um like I was trying to say, I am going to throw it away. Who wants to confess now?\" \"NOT ME!\" The boys yelled in unison. Maria waled away sadly and went upstairs where she sat on her bed and cried. Some may say she takes it too seriously but she's extremely disappointed nobody has ever don this to her ever. She sat there and thought to herself, It could not have been me I was gone all day and why would I do that to myself? Plus she went to the store. It could not have been Jack because he was gone all day unless he took it to lunch. I doubt it was the dog because he never eats human food. So it had to be one of the kids. Maria had heard everybody arguing outside her door about somebody taking the cake and they need to confess before she throws the cake away. She swung her door open. \"I am going to ask this one more time. WHO STOLE THE CAKE?\" Everybody pointed to each other, Jack pointed to Jimmy, Jimmy pointed to Jon and Jon pointed to Jack. \"OK I see nobody want to confess so bye bye cake, I am never making it again either.\" Everybody gasped and Maria pushed through her family and gasped when she got downstairs, she followed the trail of crumbs and at the end of it was that missing piece of cake or what was left of it.... Who stole the cake?",

        "question": "It happened at around 9 PM. We were having our supper, a very large one (it was Saturday, and as our family tradation we eat more than usual on Saturdays). Our mother, a very fast eater, had already finished her meal. It had been a hot day, and mother retired to bed early. Suddenly a scream came from her room. We all ran to it and asked, what happened? \"The necklace is gone!\", she wailed. \"The wedding gift! It`s disappeared!\" We all were silent for a long second, then everyone started talking at the same time. \"Oh my god...\" \"Sure am glad it was insured!\" \"No way!\" \"Oh dear someone comfort her......\" \"Poor mother...\" \"Poor necklace...\" \"What necklace?\" Dad shushed us and ushured us out of the room, staying inside to comfort mom. \"Who can have done that horrible thing?\", my younger sister Sarah said. She may have been younger but also bolder and more daring than me. I shrugged. \"It could be anyone.\" \"Then how about this; we can try to find out!\" \"That`s a great idea!\" I really liked her idea, though somewhat unsure about whether we could possibly do that. \"But how will we find out?\" Sarah opened her mouth to say something, but just then the door opened and dad came out. He made us all go to bed, and walked to the living room to finish his supper. He walked in a strange way, looking like he was trying not limp. \"Why is he....\" Sarah began, but I could not hear the rest of the sentence because she had to go to her room. Anyhow, I knew she was talking about the way dad was walking. The next day, we woke early to discuss who could have taken it. \"It was such an ugly necklace. I cannot imagine who would have wanted to take it.\" Sarah said. \"It would seem ugly to us kids. Perhaps adults think it is beautiful. adults tastes are so odd, as you know. Or perhaps it was so valuable that no-one cared how ugly it would look.\" \"Well, neither you nor I nor any other youngster would have wanted it. It`s not like us to run after money.\" \"It certainly was a grown-up who stole it.\" I agreed. \"That means that neither Micheal, nor Gary, Chris or Isabella could have done it.\" \"Now we have to list the adults in this house. There`s mother, father, Uncle Henry, Aunt Mary, and Uncle John. Apart from them there is the maid.\" \"That brings us nowhere. We have no evidence against or for anyone.\" \"The maid is not allowed inside the room.\" \"Yes, she`s innocent. See, mom and dad are having breakfast right now, so we can sneak in and look about in their room for clues.\" The two of us went downstairs. Uncle John passed us in the hallway. I felt sorry to think that he was among our suspects, as I was especially fond of him and he was like me. \"Ouch! please don`t step on my foot, uncle! You do have such awfully large feet!\" I yelped. We went on to the living room. In the living room, we saw Aunt Mary and Uncle Henry looking at one of the small mysterious holes in the wall that had been there since the building had been constructed. It was a curious hole, around four feet from the ground. Uncle Henry had his finger in it. \"Just-can`t-reach-it!\" He sighed. \"I guess I`ll have to make do without a pen until I buy another.\" \"I suppose I could try?\" Aunt Mary put her finger on the hole, but it was so thick that she could not put it in. She shook her head. The short, fat man who was Uncle Henry shrugged. \"It`s too deep inside anyway.\" We reached the room. \"There it is-the safe. It is on top of the cupboard, five and a half feet high. I remember dad saying it`s key is in an awfully secret place, and he wouldn`t tell anyone where except mother. He also said that the lock cannot be picked except by a very expert finger.\" I said, looking at the safe. It was black in colour, and had a strangely large keyhole on its right. It was rectangular, with the width just slightly longer than the height. I looked around the room. It was almost a perfect cube. Driven by sheer instinct, I knelt down and looked under the bed. There was a strange print on the carpet, which was particularly soft over there. Just then Sarah, who was looking around the cupboard, exclaimed: \"Look! There`s a footprint on the carpet! It`s just by the cupboard, see there? But mom and dad always take off their shoes before going in. It's so small. That`s strange, isn`t it?\" \"It's a clue, all right. There... wait a minute....\" Suddenly I had a flash of inspiration. \"I know who did it! I know, I know! In the room, now! I`ll tell you there!\" Who stole the necklace?",

        "question": "“You’re the worst detective ever,” said my brother. “What does that make you?” I shot back. “You’re WORKING for the worst detective ever.” My brother Larry didn’t say anything. He just glared at the phone, which sat silently on his messy desk. It hadn’t rung in more than two days. And that had been a wrong number. We’d been working together for three years, and we were starting to drive each other crazy. Larry came in to work with me, and we left together at the end of the day. And since we hadn’t had a customer all week, we’d spent a full eight hours every day cooped up together in our tiny office—and then all night watching detective reruns in the apartment we shared. Three years ago, the two of us had become famous after finding a stolen painting. It disappeared from a banker’s Halloween party, and the reporters had a lot of fun writing about the “haunted mansion.” When we’d figured out the painting’s whereabouts, they’d naturally written more stories, this time celebrating Larry and me as brilliant detectives. But the banker was one of our neighbors, and our “brilliant” detecting had just been to notice him smuggling the painting to an art collector as soon as the police stopped watching him. It was my brother Larry who’d gotten the bright idea of cashing in on our success by forming a detective agency. (“HERO DETECTIVES LAUNCH INVESTIGATION OFFICE” blared one headline in the local newspaper.) We’d framed the article and hung it on our wall the day we opened. It was still hanging there—over the phone that hadn’t rung in two days. And then we heard footsteps coming down the hallway ... Larry looked at me, and the few hairs left on his head were sticking up with alarm. No one ever walked down our hallway—and least of all, customers. Was it a criminal who we’d locked away, finally coming back for revenge? Larry nodded towards the door, signaling that he wanted me to answer it. And then he tiptoed toward the corner and hid in the closet. I was worried, too. The glass on our door was frosted, but I could see the outline of an enormous body —and then a giant fist pounded abruptly on the wood. I’d had enough of this detective business, and flung open the door. The mysterious guest had a bucket and a mop. It was our janitor, Joe. I sighed with relief, and Joe smiled back. “Did I scare you?” he asked. “I was trying to scare you.” “Detectives don’t scare easily,” I said. And then Larry opened the door of the closet and reentered the room. Joe stifled a smile, and Larry said defensively, “I was looking for clues.” Joe laughed, and said, “Are you sure you weren't looking for coats?” Larry grumbled that next he’d try to locate his missing dignity. “How about finding this month’s rent?” Joe suggested. I started to explain we were working on a big case. “Yeah, the case of the missing rent,” Joe persisted. I could see Larry getting annoyed. But then Joe said, “No, I’m serious. I can’t find this month’s rent checks. Everybody stuffs them into that rent box on the wall by the manager’s door. The box was fine when I left last night. But when I came in this morning—the box was open, and empty. I think someone picked the lock and stole all the rent checks.” “Ours was in there already,” Larry lied. “If it’s missing, that’s not our fault.” “Would you shut up and listen to me?” Joe snapped. “Mr. Jorgensen always pays his rent in cash—so there was one thousand dollars in that box! If I don’t find it, he’s going to think I stole it.” “Why would he think you stole it?” Joe reached into his gray overalls and pulled out an enormous set of jangling keys. “Janitors have keys to the whole building,” he said sadly, “including the rent box. And now that it’s missing—I’m the likeliest suspect.” It was quiet for a second, until Larry finally blurted out, “Are you hiring us?” “Tell you what,” Joe said wearily. “From the way you’re acting I’m guessing you guys still haven’t paid your rent yet. Am I right?” Larry and I both nodded. “Find that money before the manager gets here, and I won’t tell him that you guys were late again this month.” It was the best offer we’d gotten all week. “But how do we know you didn’t steal it?” Larry teased. “You don’t,” Joe said. “I’d like a thousand bucks as much as anybody.” He slid his bucket into the hallway, and headed for the elevator. *\t\t\t\t*\t\t\t\t* Larry and I ordered sandwiches—we always thought better after a good meal. We were happy and cheerful when they finally arrived, and as we munched away, Larry tossed out some theories. “Maybe Mr. Jorgensen is late on his rent too,” he said, wiping some mustard off his lips. “So Jorgensen breaks into the box, and then claims he’s paid his rent already.\" “Like what you tried to do.” “Exactly.” “Maybe you stole the money,” I said. I took a bite of my roast beef sandwich, then offered yet another theory. “Or maybe the building manager stole the money. He’s going to keep the thousand dollars, and then blame the theft on Joe.” “Or maybe Joe stole the money,” Larry said, “and he’s going to blame it on the building manager.” My head was starting to hurt. Just then, there was another knock on our door. Larry grumbled about his lunch was being interrupted as he carried his sandwich with him to his closet hiding place. “Who is it?” I asked, swallowing the last of my roast beef. “It’s Mr. Jorgensen,” said an elderly voice. From the closet, Larry called in a high-pitched voice, “Mr. Jorgensen who?” “Mr. Jorgensen-wants to-wring-your-neck. Now open the door, you jackass.” I looked over at Larry, and asked, “Why are you giving him a hard time?” Larry looked sheepish. “I owe him money, too.” Mr. Jorgensen looked very angry when we finally opened the door. “Hello, boys,” he said. We weren’t boys, but Mr. Jorgensen was nearly sixty years old—so to him, everyone looked younger. His sweater was probably older than we were, and even it looked angry. It was red with a crooked, darker red stripe that made it look like the sweater was scowling at us. “Would you like a sandwich?” asked Larry. Mr. Jorgensen shook his head. “My stomach can’t handle anything stronger than soup,” he complained. “You know what it's like to eat nothing but soup?” In response, Larry just took a big bite of his sandwich. This irritated Mr. Jorgensen, and he glared straight at Larry. “So, any chance you’ll be paying me back that five hundred dollars you borrowed from me?” “It’s funny that you mention that,” Larry said, his mouth still full. “Just yesterday I came by your office to pay you. But you were busy with a client, so I decided not to interrupt you.” “You’re lying,” said Mr. Jorgensen. “See this?” He gestured towards his neck. Larry and I both stared at his ugly sweater. Poking over the neckline was about two inches of what was probably a red silk Hawaiian shirt. Mr. Jorgensen also had a dark suntan, a result of his recent trip to Hawaii, and he explained, “I just got back from the airport—and I’m on my way up to the office now—I definitely wasn’t here yesterday.” “Did I say yesterday?” Larry asked. “Oh, uh … I meant … last Christmas.” Mr. Jorgensen mumbled something under his breath—though I definitely heard the word “stupid”—and shuffled out of our office. “You’re making friends with everybody,” I said. And once again, we heard footsteps coming down the hall. Returning to the closet, Larry shoved the last of his sandwich into his mouth. This time the closet was a good idea, because the man at our doorway was the building manager—and he was so mad that his face was red. By the time our door swung open, he was already shouting. “Give me one reason why I shouldn’t throw you two out of here!” Larry stayed in the closet. I sighed and said, “Because we’re trying to help Joe find your missing rent money?” That slowed him down. He was probably just as mad about the missing rent as he was at us for missing rent. He thought for a second. “I think it was someone in the building who stole the rent,” he said. “Someone busted open the back door and went straight to the rent box by my office. So it had to be someone who knew exactly where to look. Someone like you.” “But it could’ve been anyone,” I said. “Why are you blaming us?” “Because you’re the only guys who haven’t paid your rent this month,” he said. “And besides—I don’t like you. Your brother is a big wise guy. Where is he, anyways?” “Oh, he’s around here someplace,” I said, trying not to stare at the closet. Our building manager stomped out of the office. It was quiet for nearly a minute, until I heard Larry’s voice whispering, “Is he gone?” I turned to the closet, then said, “Look at us. We’ve got no money, and everybody hates us. Maybe we should quit the detective business altogether.” Opening the door to the closet, Larry laughed. “Not today. I had lots of time to think in there—and I’ve figured out who stole the rent money!” Who stole the rent money?",

        "question": "I’m from a small town, which helps me to understand this one. Small towns have their strengths, sure. People tend to pitch in and help one another, even when the television news cameras are not recording what’s going on. But also, small towns can be inbred. People nourish their grievances, and then feed on them. That’s why I don’t think the really vicious crimes only happen in the big cities. There’s plenty of material for that right here in Centerville. And I see it, writing for the Chronicle. Actually, you might think the whole Davis clan was working here, from the bylines I get. The business and city hall reporting comes out under my real name, James Harding Davis. For the sports pages, they use my college nickname, Crusher Davis, which used to be pretty accurate on the football field. Not many plays came my way, when the offense got a good look at my build: six foot six and two-hundred-sixty-five pounds. So much for fame in a small town. Nowadays, the Chronicle reporter who gets the most readership is Ask Martha, the advice columnist, and yes, that’s me too … but don’t tell anybody. I didn’t know when I started the column that it would be such a help to the Centerville Police Department. CPD is a pretty fancy term for three people: Inspector Samuels, one deputy, and the City Council member who oversees the police, Linda Amberton. She glories in the title “Chief,” as if she knew anything about crime solving. Well, now she knows a lot more. As a matter of fact, “Chief” Linda Amberton was the one who brought the latest case to Inspector Samuels. She came in quietly—a rarity for her—eased herself into his private office, looked both ways, and then told her story. As Inspector Samuels told me over coffee not long afterward, she told him she had been the victim of a blackmail attempt. “My hat’s off to her,” Samuels said. “Not many people would have the courage to do what she did. Most would just pay up and hope it went away.” “I’m all ears, Inspector. Blackmail sounds like a call, or perhaps a letter, usually anonymous, and always untraceable.” “You’ve got that right, Mar—I mean Crusher. It was a letter that she found in her mailbox. There was no stamp, so it hadn’t gone through the system at all. Someone just left it there.” “And it said?” He looked embarrassed. I continued, “As usual, Inspector, what you tell me about your investigations stays confidential.” That decided him, and he went on. “It said to get together ten thousand dollars in small bills. It seems that City Council Member Linda Amberton has a past. What the letter also said—it’s being dusted for fingerprints now, Crusher, not that I expect any will be found—is that twenty years ago, before she married Martin Amberton, she was really dirt poor. And she had a mother who depended on her. That was, of course, before her mother’s remarriage. So Linda started lifting clothing from stores. This was in her hometown, Riverton.” I nodded. Riverton was fifty miles down the Interstate. “Linda was caught. She got a suspended sentence, and the files were sealed. She was given a job, and paid everthing back. But that’s hardly the typical background for a City Council member. So the letter demands a large sum of money to keep the secret.” “Not that blackmailers ever stop with one demand.” “Of course they don’t. No sense of professional ethics! Naturally, we are discretely staking out the Amberton house, in case there are new communications.” “Who knows about Linda’s past?” “According to her, just her husband, Martin Amberton, in Centerville. She told him about it years ago.” “Who knew about it, back when it happened?” “Dr. Horace Sage gave her the needed job. Dr. Sage is getting on in years, and will be retiring soon. Susan Elliott was the file clerk at the courthouse, but the position is now held by Mary Devers; Mrs. Elliott has retired to Florida. Then there is Susan Royster, an old college friend of Ms. Amberton’s, who helped her settle in here in Centerville, and get a fresh start. Royster even drove her over from Riverton, since Mrs. Amberton didn’t drive then, and doesn’t now.” “Anything about the files being stolen?” “No. They are still sealed. As it happens, old Judge Thornton is still fairly active. He unsealed the records for me, in the interests of justice, and at Linda Amberton’s request. They still bore the same seal—literally—as when the court so ordered, twenty years ago. By the way, Riverton has changed its official seal, and the original one has been destroyed.” “How is the ransom money supposed to be delivered?” “That wasn’t said, oddly enough. My guess is that the next communication will be about delivering the money.” “Can she get it together?” “Yes. Her mother and stepfather left her very well fixed. He had that iron mill that used to employ half the town. A good thing, because the Ambertons have been living on her money for years.” “So you’re really in a waiting mode now?” “Well, yes, but I don’t like a blackmailer calling the shots. That’s where you come in, Crusher. You hear a lot, through that advice column of yours.” “I’m already on it, Inspector. By the way, have you interviewed Sage, Devers and Royster?” “Yes. Frankly, I couldn’t picture any of them sending a blackmail letter, although Dr. Sage and Susan Royster clearly need the money. His retirement money has gone up in smoke, one of Madoff’s victims, he said. And Susan Royster lost her job at the hospital when they had the cutbacks last February.” “Anything else?” “Well … I suppose I’m too old fashioned, for a cop. I didn’t go into details about why I was asking questions.” *** My first interview was with Dr. Sage. He was a wrinkled general practitioner. Yes, he remembered Linda very well; Linda Molton, as she then was. “She remembers you very well, too, Dr. Sage. Says that she owes you a lot, for giving her a job when she really needed it.” “Well, she was a good person and a hard worker. By the way, the interview was cooked in advance. I had had a call, you see, from my old friend and fraternity brother, Judge Thornton. He said she’d been in some trouble; he wasn’t specific, but let me know that it was nothing that a good job and three square meals a day wouldn’t fix. So I hired her.” “Many thanks, Dr. Sage.” Mary Devers knew all about the case—it turns out that her predecessor at the courthouse was gossipy. “That Molton woman really got off lucky. Must have charmed old Judge Thornton, if you ask me!” I wasn’t about to. Susan Royster had a quiet dignity. She talked about Linda Amberton from the old days. I brought up the fact that she had helped Linda settle in Centerville. “So, she shoplifted in a terrible time. So what! I was pleased to help her. Still am,” Susan added, with a vigorous nod of her head. *** The inspector and I met ten days later, when word came from Mr. Amberton that a second blackmail letter had showed up in the Amberton mailbox, one night when our surveillance detective had literally gone to sleep on the job. It demanded that Linda Amberton drive to a secluded location on the southern side of town and leave the money in a flour sack behind a small grove of white birch trees, off the road at the fifteen-mile marker. “Does she really have to do this?” her husband asked. “She put this all behind her a long time ago. I’ll drive her if it’s absolutely necessary, but it isn’t right.” Inspector Samuels started to say something, but my hand on his shoulder stopped him. “That won’t be necessary, Mr. Amberton. We know who the blackmailer is.” Who is the blackmailer?",

        "question": "Carol Ludlow amazed the hospitality industry when she hired troubled teens to work at her restaurant, Desserts on Me. The restaurant took off and she felt happy that she had improved the lives of these young people. The kids didn’t always get along, but Carol thought that by showing them encouragement and kindness, she’d be setting a good example. She gave them each specific responsibilities at the restaurant. Dan was in charge of keeping the restaurant exterior clean and presentable. David, who was her newest hire, kept the kitchen clean, washing dishes and putting away supplies. Teresa was a natural when it came to baking, and Carol entrusted her with the recipes for the cakes and pies. Robert had a talent for management, and Carol often left him in charge when she went out to run errands. One Monday morning, Carol returned from one of those errand runs to find Officer Whitcomb in the dining room of the restaurant, examining her cash register. “Hello, Miss Ludlow. I’m sorry to spring this on you, but your employee Robert called in a theft. Three hundred dollars is missing from your cash register.” Carol raised her eyebrows. “Oh, dear!” “Robert said you left exactly three hundred in there this morning in case any deliveries arrived. When the dairy delivery arrived, Robert came in here to get the money and discovered it missing. He called us immediately, and I only just arrived. Robert said he can hear the front door ring from the kitchen and he didn’t hear it once, other than when I entered. The dairy delivery came to the back, as usual. There’s really only one possibility: the thief must be one of your employees.” Carol felt a lump form in her throat. “You gotta expect problems from kids like these. Sometimes they don’t know what’s right. I’ve told them all to stay in the kitchen. I’ll begin the interviews, and you can press charges when I figure out which of the troublemakers did it.” “No, no, I’ll handle it.” Carol thanked the officer and ushered him out. She told him she’d be in touch if she thought she needed his help. As he left, the door made its usual loud ringing sound. Carol walked into the kitchen to greet her employees. Robert, Teresa, David and Dan all stood silently, waiting for her to yell at them. Carol took a deep breath and said, “I know you’ve all heard about the robbery. We’ll talk about it a little later. Right now, I want to unpack the things I bought while running my errands.” Carol placed the bag of supplies she had bought onto the kitchen counter. She removed the rubber gloves from the bag and placed them into the empty glove holder. Then she took out the towels she had purchased and hung them on the racks in the kitchen. The kids had been messier than normal this week and all of the regular towels were at the cleaners. Carol walked back into the dining room and sat down at one of the tables. As she thought about the missing three hundred dollars, she felt sad. Obviously, one of her employees must have needed the money for something important. She decided she would call in the kids one by one to try to figure out who did it and why. Robert entered first. He had long brown hair and a shiny crystal stud in his ear. “So how did everything go today, Robert?” “Okay. I stayed in the kitchen all morning watchin’ Teresa make that Black Forest Cake. You know how messy she gets. I just wanted to stop her from getting batter everywhere.” “Thanks, Robert.” “I wouldn’t even let her go to the bathroom till she finished. She would have gotten batter everywhere, and I thought it was better to be sure she finished her work before she took any kind of break. The only time I left her alone was when I went out back to greet the dairy deliveryman.” “Well we’ll have to talk about the bathroom thing later, but in the meantime, why don’t you send Teresa out here?” “Sure, Miss L.” A moment later, Teresa came into the dining room, her patched-up jeans and T-shirt covered in flour. “Hi, Miss L.” She reached out to shake Carol’s hand, then looked down at her batter-covered fingers. “Sorry.” “So how are you doing, Teresa?” “Fine. Except Robert didn’t leave me alone all morning, besides going out back to greet the dairy deliveryman. He said I couldn’t go to the bathroom till I finished the cake.” She tossed her long blond hair behind her shoulders. “He kept on making jokes about me being so messy. Why does he do that?” As Teresa spoke, she gestured with her hands and flour puffed off of her clothes. She smiled sheepishly. “Sorry, again.” “That’s okay. I know you’re trying hard.” “Can I go to the bathroom now?” “Sure, honey.” Teresa nodded and rushed away. A few moments later, David entered the dining room wearing his usual baseball cap. His rake-thin body trembled as he sat beside Carol. “I had a terrible day,” he said. “Why?” asked Carol. “I forgot about my skin allergies.” David rubbed his hands. “I accidentally put on rubber gloves when I did the dishes and it made my hands swell up. I could hardly move ’em.” “How do they feel now?” “A little better, but I still can’t move them very well.” She looked at his hands. “Do you want me to call Doc Robbins?” “No, that’s okay. I’m sure they’ll be alright soon.” Carol nodded. “By the way, did Robert, Teresa or Dan talk to you today? Are they making you feel welcome?” A sullen expression appeared on David’s face as he shook his head no. Then he stood up and slowly walked back to the kitchen. Dan sauntered into the dining room next. A tall boy, he had tattoos all over his arms. “Hiya, Miss L. Did you see how amazing the front of the restaurant looks now?” “Yes, very nice, Dan. How long did it take you to clear away all the leaves?” “An hour or so. I had a very difficult time—the wind blew the leaves everywhere. But I finally did it. I’m proud of how neat and tidy it looks now.” “That’s great!” Dan walked back to join the others in the kitchen, and Carol folded her hands on her lap. As she thought about all the answers that her employees had given her, she realized that one of them had given something away. Carol knew who’d stolen the money. Who stole the money?",

        "question": "Lilly Scarce raised the binoculars to her eyes, curious to see what was going on. A cloud of smoke was billowing from the school library, and erupted in fierce flames. People--Who to Lilly looked like ants because of the bridge she was standing on-- rushed out onto the grassy meadow of the campus. A raw smell filled Lilly's nose and tickled her face. The smoke was really getting thick now, as it turned from a misty grey to black in only a matter of seconds. Lilly rushed down to the school, stumbling over rocks and tripping over weeds, but she was too late. The library was destroyed, as firefighters extinguished the last of the fire. \"Lilly Scarce!\" called the librarian from behind her. She was flailing her arms and looked as if her best friend had died. Though, it kind of did, as the library burned down. Lilly Scarce turned around. \"Yes, Miss Raleigh?\" \"You're the detective. Please, you have to figure out what happened to the library. I know it wasn't any accident. We managed to salvage the security camera, and there was a figure with a red hoodie under it, lighting five or six matches to oil! I don't even know what they were doing, hours are 8:00 Am to 3:00 Pm! \" The frazzled librarian said all of this very fast. \"Calm down,\" Lilly soothed. After all, she was the teenage detective around this place. Everyone knew it, too. \"I'll figure out who did it, don't worry.\" \"Thank you, child! Thank you so much!\" Arm bracelets jingling, the woman stumbled away, sobbing. Lilly stepped inside the library, only to find a security guard to stop her. \"No access,\" he said, his voice gruff. \"I was just wondering if I could see the security footage,\" Lilly asked, choosing her words carefully. “Why should you need such an important thing?” asked the security guard. “I just need it. Please?” “No! You’re just a kid, anyways. I’m not going to let some fifteen year old girl ruin evidence,” the security guard retaliated. “Um, sixteen, actually, and I’m the detective, you’re just the security guard, so just let me do my job. Or do we need to get the police in here to confirm that?” Reddening, the security guard gave her the tape from his pocket. “Here.” That night, Lilly sat in her room with her laptop on her desk, plopping in the CD. A few scraggly sounds raffled out, but then the screen showed a picture of a red hood setting fire to the library. She remembered seeing five people hanging around outside the school, earlier that day. She recognized them instantly as Jade Foster, Madelyn Reader, Jock Mat, and Max Crabgrass. The next day, she went to the library. The security guard was still standing there. Man, when was that guy ever going to move? She thought. “You again!” he said angrily. “Well, you can’t come in here. It’s too dangerous, anyways.” “Sorry, I have to investigate,” Lilly replied. “Too bad.” The security guard didn’t want her going in the library to investigate. Could he be a suspect? “How come you won’t let me get through?” she complained. “I have to investigate.” “Kids aren’t a loud!” He gripped Lilly’s arm just above the elbow. Just then, Miss Raleigh came to her rescue. “Release her,” she snapped. The security guard obeyed. “She can look around in the library. She’s an investigator.\nLilly looked around the burned down bookshelves and found a football jersey in the ashes, burned, and obviously worn. She flipped it over and on the back she could just make out the words “Mat.” Jock was on the football team, could he have gotten too hot and took this off during the attack? And Max Crabgrass, as she remembered, had a red sweatshirt that he loved so much. He could have done it as well. Crumbling books and other ashes aligned the walls of the spacious room as she pondered this theory. The security guard was watching her immensely and suspiciously. He was definitely on the suspect list. Anyone could have done it, anyone at all. Lilly called all of the suspects to the office, even the security guard. \"What do you want, Scarce?\" asked Madelyn. \"Shush,\" replied Lilly. “No one needs your sass, Madelyn. Someone set fire to the library last night, and you guys were hanging around the crime scene right before it happened. What were you guys doing?\" \"I was going home,\" said Madelyn stubbornly, “I’ve got better things to do than stick around school like the rest of these no good losers.” “You don’t have to be so mean. I saw you hanging around the school right before the attack. Explain that,” Lilly commented. “I was trying to get one of them to do my homework. I still didn’t. Besides, I’d have no reason to burn down the library.” The girls glared at each other, then Lilly continued. “Jade, explain to me what you were doing around the crime scene right before the attack.” \"I was studying around four o clock, but I went home later,\" Jade said. “Max? What were you doing? There was a red sweatshirt on the arsonist, just like the one that you love so much. \"I was helping out Ms. Thornburg, my home room teacher,\" said Max. “And besides, my sweatshirt went missing a long time ago. “ “Jock, when I was looking around the library, I saw your football jersey. It had your name on the back. Explain.” \"I have football practice every Friday, you know that, Scarce. My jersey was missing, so the coaches made me run laps.\" Jock added. “Security guard, you sure were acting strange when I was looking around in the library. That makes you a suspect.” “If you must know, I was watching you, hopping that you wouldn’t hurt yourself. That’s my job. I’d get fired if you fell or something and I failed to rescue you. I can’t afford to set fire to the library, even though I hate reading.” The security guard bowed his head, and then continued solemnly. “I don’t want to lose my job. My wife will kill me and I’ll lose all of my money!” Jade Foster threw down her purse, a red shirt falling to the floor. \"This is crazy!\" “Really Jade? I think it’s crazy that someone set fire to the library, so don’t try to worm your wave off the list.” “Actually, I agree with Jade, I mean, I don’t think anyone would have done it purposefully,” said Jock. “I have football practice in an hour.” “Well, one of you won’t be saying that when you get arrested!” Lilly replied. Suddenly, Mrs. Raleigh burst through the door. \"Oh, hi Lilly. I came to give Jade back her report card.  You got an F in reading, Jade. I managed to salvage it in the fire. You might want to study just a bit harder because if you keep going at this rate….” She trailed off. ”Oh, and did you figure out who the arsonist was, Lilly? I see you have all of your suspects. \" \"As a matter of fact, I think I just did.\" Who is the arsonist?",

        "question": "Andersonville Military Prison, deep in the heart of Dixieland Georgia, was the most dreaded of Confederate prisoner-of-war camps. It was such a grim place that the rebel soldiers guarding it were fed and clothed little better than their 33,000 Yankee prisoners. From its inception in February 1864, until the Civil War’s end 14 months later, 13,000 prisoners would die; an astonishing 29% mortality rate. Many of the Union soldiers succumbed to starvation and exposure to the elements, but some were also murdered, as was the case with Private Glendenning Bryan. Sgt. Crosby, Sgt. Thornton, Pvt. Whisenant and Cpl. Horner shared a tent with Pvt. Bryan – if you could call a few small tree limbs that served as poles, plus a few tattered blankets and threadbare shirts, shelter at all. Because the tent was so small, privacy was virtually non-existent, and this only added to the shock and dismay when the friendly Bryan, a young 19-year-old from Boston, was found dead with a knife wound in his stomach when the sun came up early one steamy Monday morning in August 1864. Crosby, the 38-year-old no-nonsense senior non-commissioned officer and Chicago, Illinois, policeman, took charge. Speaking within the confines of the small tent, he said, “He’s murdered, murdered right here. I don’t know why, he would’ve been dead in a few days anyway.” Bryan had been in Andersonville the longest and was the most malnourished and sickest of the five. However, they soon discovered why Bryan had been killed. He had been hoarding food in his clothing, planning to eat it when he felt better. Inside his trousers they found a crudely sewn, hidden pocket that contained breadcrumbs and a few tiny pieces of salt pork. The likable Bryan had been killed for food. “Well, it wasn’t me that did it,” said the short-tempered Horner, another native of Massachusetts, as he viewed his friend who lay dead just inches from his bare feet. “My hands are useless with arthritis and I can’t hardly hold a knife.” Horner was 40-years-old and had spent too many years shoeing horses in the cold weather of his home in Worcester. “It couldn’t have been me,’ chimed in Thornton. “I was outside walking most of the night.” “Most of the night is not all of the night,” Crosby pointedly replied. Thornton, a 26-year-old librarian from Philadelphia and quietest of the residents of the tent, winced at this suggestion. “Did anyone see you?” asked Crosby. Thornton looked at each man in turn before answering, “Nobody saw me, but I was out walking last night. I was.” “I was sick, couldn’t eat, couldn’t sleep, so I was down by the sinks all night,” offered Whisenant, the normally amiable 30-year-old New York school teacher. “I got back here just a few minutes ago.” Crosby hadn’t slept in the tent the previous night, either, and told them so. “I was at the other end of the camp, trying to get what fresh night air was available.” That was an ironic statement, as it was known that the stench from Andersonville was so severe it was noticed in the city of Americus, several miles away. “I didn’t notice any of you fellers last night. Just me and Bryan,” said Horner, thinking out loud. Slowly, he asked, “Who owns the knife?” “Answer that and we have our killer,” Thornton added, dryly. For a few minutes they all sat in silence. Finally, Crosby said, “I got back here first. I found Horner asleep and Bryan dead.” Horner shot Crosby a mean look, pointed a gnarled finger at him and said, “I told you I didn’t kill him!” He winced in pain as he did so. “Easy, corporal, easy, I’m just thinking.” “Well, for whatever it’s worth to you, I didn’t sleep well,” Horner said. “Who does in this place? I was asleep for only an hour or two and did not see or hear anything, except the usual camp noises.” “OK, let’s continue,” said Crosby. “I was on the other side of the camp with various friends; not with any one person the entire night, but I was never alone.” Turning to Thornton, he asked, “What about you? Horner didn’t sleep well, says he didn’t see you.” “He probably didn’t. I only came back to the tent a couple of times. When I heard him snoring, I did not go in. I didn’t want to bother him. The last time was about an hour ago. It was too dark to notice anything unusual about Bryan.” Crosby digested this for a moment and then asked Whisenant, “You were sick last night?” “Right,” he replied. The sight and shock of the dead Bryan did nothing to quiet his queasiness, although he was a butcher by trade in his hometown of Zeeland, Michigan. With great effort, he managed to control a wave of nausea. He needed to go outside and Crosby excused him. Whisenant returned a few minutes later, weak but feeling better. He dreaded resuming the conversation, but he re-seated himself in the cramped tent and looked at Crosby. Finally, Crosby stated bluntly, “I know who killed Bryan.” Who is the killer?",

        "question": "“Say what you will about the Straw Hat circuit,” Arthur Glendon observed, “it does get us out of New York for the hot summer.” He waved a hand around, taking in the Straw Hat Theater, with its inviting lodge and Summer Theater, a hillside picture book Vermont setting. Janice Starling smiled. “Oh, I don’t know, Summer Theater is rather fun, and all that, I’ll agree, but we’re all hoping for something new, something to take us back to Broadway.” “As if you had ever been there, except for buying a ticket as a member of the audience for one of my plays,” Alice Cartwright said. “But Janice does have a point. New York is where the best opportunities are in the theater. Frankly, when I’m not in the city” - she said the word as though only one city existed in the world - “I just can’t wait to get back. Anyway, Arthur, what play are you casting for? I assume from your message on my cell phone, and the presence of these ladies that you have something specific in mind.” “No need to get over dramatic, dear,” interjected Sandra Buckingham, seated on the most comfortable chair in the room, which she had chosen as her entitlement. “It won’t help you get the part, whatever Arthur has in mind.” “Thank heavens I only asked the three of you!” Arthur thought. What he actually said was quite different. “We’re doing a new play, a comedy, “All’s Right, Now That You’re Here”. There is a wonderful female romantic lead, Rosemary. She’s full of fun and deviltry.” He paused for effect. “Surely one of you at least will fit the part perfectly. I have the scripts for you here. Take them back to the lodge. I’ll hear tryouts tomorrow morning at ten. Then we’ll really get down to business, with excerpts from the play. You - I mean for rehearsal, and then the lead actually selected - will be reading opposite Rex Lansford. I’ll be picking him up later tonight at the airport.” That was Arthur Glendon’s moment, and he had played it to the hilt. The three women gasped. Nobody had expected to find, in this rural corner of Vermont, that Rex Lansford would be playing in Summer Theater. Lansford, they all knew, had just last week celebrated the opening of his latest film, a summer blockbuster that was earning more than Steven Spielberg’s latest. Each woman knew that playing opposite Hollywood’s most bankable leading man could launch a career, or jump-start a stalled one. Janice Starling, Sandra Buckingham and Alice Cartwright each swore that she would get that part - nothing would stand in the way of that happening. They took their scripts and melted away to the lodge. The actresses came to the realization at just about the same time. The play’s story was about an actress who got her big break by making sure that the competition for the part was unable to try out. It all seemed rather amateurish, a laxative substituted for a chocolate bar, a misleading phone message that the tryout was rescheduled, that sort of thing. It was an updated, “All About Eve” with an edge. But it was also a broad comedy, played strictly for laughs, and the part absolutely sparkled. Played opposite Rex Lansford, who knew where it might lead? And just what did Arthur Glendon have in mind, anyway? Didn’t he know how nervous he was making them? Was life supposed to imitate art, or the other way around? Three guards went up, and the three actresses each made plans to secure the part. The more they read the play, the more the part sparkled, and the more they suspected each other. They each came to dinner and sat at separate tables, glowering across the dining room. Nobody was going to slip a laxative past them! The evening was devoted to rehearsal preparation, each in her own room. It went on and on. In the wee hours of the morning, Sandra Buckingham talked so loudly that Alice Cartwright, who had the room just beneath Sandra’s, pounded on the ceiling with a stick to quiet her rival. The noise stopped. “Well, she’s really there after all,” Alice thought. “We’ll see about her in the morning!” Janice Starling, who had the room next to Alice Cartwright, yawned in exhaustion. She decided not to go to breakfast in the morning. She asked the front desk for a wake up call, then took a sleeping pill and went back to bed. Promptly at ten o’clock the following morning, Alice and Sandra were on the set, ready for the casting call. Arthur was first on the set as usual. He frowned, but refused the suggestion that someone be sent to remind the missing Janice Starling that she was overdue for the tryout. “Pass me some of that hot lemonade, will you dearie?” Sandra said to Alice. Alice poured a mug of hot lemonade from the rolling snack bar just off the set. It was Sandra’s habit during rehearsals - so ingrained that directors made fun of the “hot lemonade” clause in her contracts. She wanted to clear her throat before going on stage. Sandra got just half way through her prepared monologue when she gasped and grabbed her throat. “What’s going on!” she managed to say, in between coughs ... “Somebody sabotaged this drink. It’s got vinegar in it!” She glared at Alice and tried wildly to find something to clear her vocal cords. Finally, she sat down and stared at Glendon. “Give me some time to get over this,” she said. “Of course, dear,” Glendon replied, in his very best butter-wouldn’t-melt tone of voice. He made a call with his cell phone, and then motioned to Alice Cartwright to begin her presentation. She started her monologue, but at that moment, Rex Lansford came onto the set. Glendon waved at Alice to continue, but with Lansford as a surprised witness, he and Sandra spent the next twenty minutes telling each other loud, boisterous stories. From onstage, Alice Cartwright looked at them first pleadingly, then in an imperious way, every inch Mary Queen of Scots faced with her persecutors. Then Janice Starling entered the set, out of breath, dress barely arranged, embarrassed, and full of apologies. “I left a wakeup call, but they never called me until just a few minutes ago,” she said. The excuse sounded lame, and her voice began to lose confidence. Arthur Glendon made a great show of looking at his watch. Janice glared at him and broke into her monologue. It was brilliantly performed. She smiled and left the stage. “Not so fast,” Alice said. “If you two are now ready to listen, I’m ready to perform.” Her monologue was flawless. Sandra had cleared her throat at last. She had spent the evening memorizing Rosemary’s key speech at the end of Act Two. It was so well done, that even her competitors applauded. Then Rex Lansford spoke to the three women. “You are all fine actresses, and Rosemary is a special part, somewhat devilish, I think Arthur told you. Just think what she would have done to get her part.” Then a light seemed to dawn, and the veteran star added, “I know what happened, and who is responsible for this very odd and untraditional tryout.” Who sabotaged the tryouts?",

        "question": "Katie Johnson and Alicia Cates were best friends. The women were genuinely fond of one another, and their friendship had an added benefit: The Cates and Johnson families lived next door to each other, and so the two mothers often teamed up when working with the children and their various church and school activities. One sunny day in early spring, the moms planned a fun outing for the five kids. Katie had two girls, Emilee and Olivia, ages nine and three, respectively. Alicia had two boys and one girl: Trevor was the oldest at age six, followed by four-year-old Justin and two-year-old Brianna. Since school was out for Emilee, Katie and Alicia promised the kids a trip to the candy store at the mall. Darby’s Confectionary was not just any candy store. It was huge, with lots of floor space divided into sections that carried just about every type of sweets in existence. It even had an “Old Time Candy” department which Katie’s husband Carl loved to frequent. In fact, Katie planned to purchase a couple of packages of Sixties-era clove flavored chewing gum for him while she, Alicia and the kids visited the store. Around mid-morning, everyone piled into the Johnson SUV and headed toward the mall and Darby’s Confectionary. The children were excited, even though Katie and Alicia had set a firm rule: No candy until after lunch. They were going to the Confectionary to purchase only, and would need to save the treats for later in the afternoon. The mothers were agile young women, very quick on their feet—they needed to be when in the candy store with the children. As soon as the pleasant smell of sweets hit their little noses, the kids quickly began to spread out to explore. Katie and Alicia weren’t worried; they knew from previous experience that this was not as much of a problem as it seemed. The store was well-lit with wide aisles, and most of the candy was either behind counters or stored high enough that young children could not reach it. Besides, they had been clear about their rules for this outing, and they trusted their little ones to be respectful. The moms took their time going to the gum counter to make Katie’s purchase for Carl. Livvie, Katie’s three-year-old, went with them. Livvie had a nasty head cold and didn’t feel well, but Katie knew that missing a trip to the Confectionary would break the little girl’s heart. Livvie had suffered from the cold for several days and her mother hoped that getting out of the house and breathing some fresh air would make her feel better and restore her appetite. Emilee had offered to walk Brianna around the store, but being a typical two-year-old, Brianna became distracted by the section of the store where the brownies and cookies were displayed. These items were baked fresh every morning and kept in a glass case with a slide door and a low key lock in the back. Emilee had been distracted herself, looking at the hard candy, imagining they way they’d melt in her mouth. Before noticing that Brianna had wandered off, she considered asking her mom to buy a few ounces of heart-shaped mints. Mr. Darby was working in the hard candy section and asked her if she would like a sample. Emilee was tempted but replied that no, she had better not, as her mother would not like it if she found out. Mr. Darby grinned and told her to her to bring her mother over to see him before leaving and he would give her a small sample to take home. Emilee saw that Brianna had wandered off, and she quickly found her a couple of aisles over, staring at the blonde brownies and chocolate chip cookies. Brianna’s plump little fingers smudged the glass as she pointed out to Emilee the delicious-looking sweets. After grabbing a few packs of Carl’s favorite clove gum and visiting with the woman staffing the Old Time Candy department for a few minutes, the women found Trevor in the licorice section. There was licorice of all flavors and colors displayed but Alicia though it odd that her son would be looking in this area, for he had recently lost a tooth when falling off his bicycle and chewing was very painful. Katie, Alicia, and Trevor then met the girls in the bakery section. Emilee told her mom about her conversation with Mr. Darby, and Katie thanked her for following the no candy until after lunch rule. The last child they rounded up was Justin. Justin was a typical four-year-old boy who had gravitated to the messiest area of the store, the soft chocolate section. The section was partially roped off, as Mr. Darby was remodeling a display on a side wall and had left a step stool, paint drop cloth and some loose pieces of wood on the floor. Mr. Darby kept candy bars and chocolate drops in this area, but they were up just high enough that a small child could not get to them. After rounding up Justin and making several purchases, the moms and kids prepared to leave. They approached Mr. Darby, who was still behind the hard candy counter. “Good, you’ve come back for your free sample,” he said to Emilee, smiling. He looked at the young mothers. “But one of my clerks tells me that somebody had a snack they forgot to pay for.” Alicia and Katie spoke with the children for a few minutes, but none of them admitted to anything. Finally, Alicia said to Mr. Darby, “I know who the guilty party is without you having to tell me!” Who stole the snack?",

        "question": "Special Agent-in-charge Sam Connors looked over the four men standing before him in the pouring rain. Their grim faces were lit up by the jagged lightning that streaked through the sullen sky, their bodies trembling with the rolling thunder that shook the earth all around. “We’re going to get Pee Wee Galento for sure this time,” the big FBI man growled. “Dead or alive!” The men nodded, fedoras dripping. They climbed into the rumbling Ford Model A, Connors behind the wheel and drove off into the storm-wrenched night. The tip had come from an old prospector who’d been digging for gold up in the mountains: a man was holed up in an abandoned mining shack on the edge of Splithead Canyon. The prospector had identified the man as Pee Wee Galento from the FBI Most Wanted poster he’d been shown. The men sat in silence as the car roared along the deserted high Colorado road, listening to the monotonous flapping of the windshield wipers against the windscreen. The surrounding rugged countryside was shrouded in liquid darkness, except when a crashing thunderbolt tore the heavens apart. Pee Wee Galento had knocked over eight banks and gunned down three guards during his five-month crime spree. He’d vowed never to be taken alive. Joe Franklin dug around in the front of his suit jacket; his hand brushing the butt of his .32 revolver nestled in its shoulder harness. He found his pack of cigarettes, shook a coffin nail out and offered it to Chester Morris sitting next to him in the backseat of the car. Chester shook his head, said, “Don’t smoke,” his knuckles white on the barrel of the shotgun cradled between his legs. “These young guys are all into clean livin’ now, huh, Sam?” Joe remarked. He nervously plugged the cancer stick back into the pack and put the pack back into his suit pocket. “How many years you been in law enforcement, anyway, pops?” Big George Ratcliffe asked the third man in the backseat. Joe snorted. “Pops! I’m retiring at the end of the year, as a matter of fact … sonny. Me and the wife are all set for the easy life – just bought a cottage on Lake Avery.” “Not bad, old-timer,” Slim Jameson commented, turning around in the front seat. “Me, I got some things to take care of before I turn in my badge.” He patted his left breast where his .32 was holstered. “Like Pee Wee Galento, for one.” “Plus, you don’t have the dough to live on Easy Street like Joe does,” Big George said, balancing a Thompson submachine gun on his plump knees. “Playin’ the ponies like you do.” Slim grimaced. “Yeah, I got a few debts to pay off, fat guy. But who don’t these days – with the Depression and all?” Big George grunted. “Tell me about it. The bank the missus and I have been dealing at for the past five years just went under. Taking all our dough with it. And us with four kids to feed!” “Why don’t you guys shut up already!” Chester rasped. This was his first manhunt. Sam Connors glanced in the rearview mirror at the pale-faced young man in the back. “Easy, son,” he said. “We’re all in this together. We’ll get our man.” Twenty miles on, they turned off the highway and onto a rutted trail that wound up the side of a mountain. Another hour of bone-jarring, rain-lashed driving brought them to within a hundred yards of the shack perched on the edge of Splithead Canyon. Light leaked out from around the edges of the shade-drawn front window of the shack, smoke from the stovepipe up on the roof. “Big George,” Sam Connors said, “you go around and cover the back in case Pee Wee decides to bust out a window and take a tumble into the canyon. The rest of us are going through the door.” The men piled out of the car and plodded forward. A bolt of lightning flashed and crackled almost directly over their heads, thunder exploding a split-second later. Sam Connors cocked his big, black .45 automatic at the door of the shack. He nodded at his men, then reared back and slammed his huge shoulder into the flimsy plank door. “Put ‘em up, Pee Wee!” he roared. “It’s the end of the line!” The bank robber leapt out of the chair he’d been dozing in, knocking over a table. A bottle and a tin plate crashed to the plank wood floor of the shack, along with stacks and stacks of stolen money – and the Tommy gun Pee Wee had employed to get the loot. He stared at the FBI agents, dazed and unbelieving. Then the lantern hanging overhead suddenly shattered, shot out, plunging the shack into darkness. Gunfire erupted like the thunder all around, muzzles blazing flame, wood splintering and glass shattering and men screaming amidst the hail of hot lead that seemed to pour from every direction. Chester lit the lantern he’d been told to bring with him and tossed it inside the shack, illuminating the carnage. The blasting ceased. The silence was deafening, acrid gunsmoke hanging heavy in the air. The men stared at the bullet-ridden body of Pee Wee Galento slumped over against the far wall of the shack and at the crisp green money scattered all over the floor. “I got a slug in the gut,” Joe grimaced from beside Sam Connors. “I took one in the shoulder myself,” the Special Agent-in-charge replied, fingering the small hole in his trench coat. “I think a bullet winged my ear chief!” Big George yelled from the broken back window of the shack. “But I’m okay.” He was still outside the shack, but his machine gun lay inside on the floor. “I guess I dropped my Tommy in all the excitement,” the agent sheepishly admitted. Sam Connors looked at Slim crouched in a shooting position along the side-wall. “What about you, Slim?” “I think I got a chunk taken out of my thigh. But that don’t matter. We got the crumb,” he gritted, glaring at Pee Wee’s lifeless body, “that’s all that matters.” Sam Connors glanced behind him. “You can come in now, Chester.” The young FBI man slunk into the room, clutching his shotgun. “I was, um, just keeping the front door covered – in case Pee Wee broke through you guys.” Sam Connors grunted, nodding at the bank robber’s gleaming black machine gun lying on the floor. “We got a lot of men shot, and shot at … considering.” “Considering what?” Joe groaned, holding his stomach. “Considering Pee Wee Galento never fired a single shot.” The FBI special agent grimly regarded his men, his .45 level and cocked. “Looks to me like someone else was after this bank loot besides Pee Wee. And I think I know who.” Who stole the loot?",

        "question": "Barney was excited as he prepared for bed. After all, tomorrow was his favorite day of the year. For some people, it was Christmas or their birthday, but not Barney, for him, it was always April 1. He loved April Fool’s Day as he loved to play elaborate pranks on everyone that he knew. As he prepared for bed, he thought of all his planned pranks he was going to pull off tomorrow and he could hardly wait. Tomorrow was going to be a good day indeed. As he lay in bed, Barney seemed to be having the strangest of dreams. He thought he heard someone in his bedroom and then smelled ether. Then he dreamed that he was being carried out of his house and put into a car or a truck. What was strange was that he almost felt like he was living the dream, but he was not waking up. Then in his dream, he was carried somewhere and placed on a hard surface where he lay for a while. The last part of the dream was the strangest. He felt like he was moving and heard a constant clackity-clack almost like a train going over the tracks. The dream finally ended when he heard a cell phone ringing and woke up. That was when Barney realized that it was not a strange dream, but that somehow, he was sitting in a boxcar on a moving train. Meanwhile, the cell phone kept ringing, so Barney finally answered it. The voice on the other end was his good friend Fred. “Barney, you may be wondering why you are in a boxcar on a moving train. This is a payback from everyone in your life on whom you have played April Fool’s jokes over the years. We decided that it was time to play one on you. Here is what is happening. You were placed on a train that left New York City this morning at 3:00 am. The train will arrive at its destination at 10:00 am. You have until that time to determine where you are. There are five choices, with a corresponding phone number programmed into this cell phone. By 10 am, you need to call one of the five listed phone numbers. If you get the right answer and call the right number, the door to the boxcar will automatically open and you can get out. There will be a driver there ready to take you to breakfast and then take you home. However, if you dial the wrong number or if you fail to call a number by 10:00 am, you open the latch on the crate at the other end of the boxcar. In that crate are several skunks. You will then have to spend the rest of the day with the skunks. We have ensured that there are clues that will allow you to solve this mystery if you pay attention. Good luck and APRIL FOOL’s.” With that, Fred hung up. Barney was impressed that his friends would go to such great lengths. First, he tried to get his bearings. He was seated with his back up against one wall of the boxcar. From the direction of the motion, he could tell that he was facing in the direction that the train was traveling, so he was in the back of the boxcar. It was just getting light out, so he was able to see into the rest of the boxcar. Up ahead, he could see a large crate with what looked to be a clock on the top of it. That was probably the crate of skunks. He knew his friends and so he believed that they really would release a bunch of skunks into his boxcar if he did not solve the mystery. There was a chair on each side of the boxcar. The chairs were positioned so that by sitting in them, it would be possible to look out a small hole and see outside. There seemed to be something on the floor to the right of the crate, but he could not make it out as it was in the shadow of the crate. He would explore that later. Barney knew that he needed to get started, so he got up and walked to the first chair. There he saw the note taped above the wall. It said: \nHere are the potential destinations: \nPhiladelphia, PA: 94 miles Boston, MA: 216 miles Washington, DC: 229 miles Pittsburgh, PA: 339 miles Raleigh, NC: 511 miles Barney figured it was time to start looking out the peephole, so he sat down and looked out the left side. There was not much to see. Smack dab in the middle of suburbia. He could be anywhere. After a while, the train ran alongside a highway. Barney thought that if he could see all the license plates that he could figure out what state he was in. However, the cars were all going much faster than the train so he could not read the license plates. He tried watching for a little longer in the hopes he would see a highway sign, but no such luck. After a while, he decided to try the other side. As he looked out the right side of the train, Barney saw much the same things as he saw on the left side of the train. At least the scenery was a little better on this side. This side had much more greenery and was much more pleasant to look at. Maybe he would be able to find a clue from this side, so he just kept watching. After a while, a park came into view. In addition to the standard pavilions and ponds, there was a small statue of someone. Barney strained to see who it was, but alas, no luck. He was about to give up when the train came upon a biking trail. Barney tried to yell out to the people who were riding their bikes along the train, asking where he was but each time he yelled to someone, the train was well past them before they could answer back. Obviously, that was not going to help. Barney looked at the timer. He had ten minutes left to come up with an answer. Barney got up and started to pace when he stepped on something to the right of the crate; looking down, he noticed his three juggling balls. Fred obviously put them here knowing that when he truly needed to solve a problem, he always juggled. There was something about juggling these three rubber balls that allowed him to focus on a problem. Fortunately the balls had stayed here at the front of the boxcar during the entire trip. Reaching down to pick them up, he thought \"don’t fail me now\" as he started juggling. With just a minute left as the train was coming to a stop, the balls did the trick. He knew just where he was. Quickly he pulled the phone out of his pocket. Taking a deep breath of fresh air just in case, he dialed the number with thoughts of skunks running through his mind. Where is Barney?",

        "question": "The Christian Witness adult Sunday school class met every Sunday morning at 9:00 a.m. Class leader, Juliet Lowe, usually taught lessons from Biblical scripture. On this Sunday morning, there were only five members in attendance. This was neither surprising nor disturbing, as she had, through her many years as class leader, taught to as few as one person and as many as 20. The attendees this morning were all long time class members. Waylon Marsh, a retired school teacher, had attended the Christian Witness class for a little over 25 years, almost as long as Juliet. James and Judy Gant had been in class for 15 years, but had been members of their church for over 30 years. Ellie Wilson, a widow and oldest member of the group, was a charter member of Christian Witness, which was now in its 35th year. Doc Bentson was the newest member, having been with them for only 10 years. After an opening prayer, Juliet began her lesson. It came from the Gospel of Matthew 6:3-4, which states: “But when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your alms may be done in secret; and your father who sees in secret will reward you.” Juliet also included Old Testament scripture concerning the practice of tithing, citing from Deuteronomy 14:22, “Set apart a tithe of all the yield of your seed that is brought in yearly from the field.” As Juliet concluded her lesson, she was pleased, for she had incorporated scripture from both the Old and New Testaments and the class had listened and discussed intently the important concepts of doing good works in secret and tithing 10% of what one earns to the work of the Lord. Unlike most other Sunday school classes, Christian Witness collected offerings after, not before, the main lesson. Another unwritten rule that Christian Witness observed was that every member would place one dollar in the offering envelope. Juliet was aware that the rest of the church considered the Christian Witness class to be somewhat idiosyncratic and these were a couple of the reasons why. (Another reason was that is was well known that Judy Gant had, for years, made a practice of keeping detailed notes during class and usually filled up several pages). Even so, Juliet liked the tradition of everyone donating a dollar. It kept the group’s modest budget predictable and allowed class members to practice Christian discipline. Juliet, placing her dollar into the envelope first, did not pay strict attention to the others as the envelope made its way around the table. Though, she did notice Doc place a dollar bill into the envelope. She noticed also that James Gant placed a dollar bill plus change into the envelope for his and Judy’s donation. Today’s offering would be $6.00 and push the class balance to almost $100.00 As Juliet emptied the envelope to confirm the morning’s giving, she noticed something odd. The total was $6.10, including five one-dollar bills, four quarters and one dime. At first, she could not figure out why there was an extra dime. She suspected that James accidentally placed it into the envelope with his change. When questioned, James responded, “The four quarters were the only coins in my pocket.” Juliet, a former agent of the state Bureau of Investigation, was puzzled. She quickly realized that someone in class had taken her lesson to heart. A 10% tithe on top of a regular offering had been made, and it had been done so in secret. She shared her revelation with the others. Everyone grinned. “So, Juliet, who paid the secret tithe?” asked Doc. Juliet replied, “I’m not sure. I need to ask a couple of questions.” Another rule of Christian Witness was that no falsehoods were ever spoken within the classroom walls. She knew she would hear the truth. First, she asked Judy, “Do you, or did you, have coins in your skirt pocket?” Judy answered, “No, and, even if I did, I had a pencil in my hand when the envelope was being passed around.” Turning to Ellie, she asked, “Ellie, do you have your handbag with you?” “Yes.” “May I see it?” Ellie arose from her seat and headed toward the classroom door. She brought her purse back over to the table. “This thing’s heavy and I’m getting old, so I just parked it by the door today,” she announced. She offered it to Juliet, who noticed that it was an old fashioned handbag, somewhat large and obviously full of various items. The snap top was clasped shut. “The only thing I had with me at the table was the dollar for the offering,” Ellie insisted. Juliet said nothing, but then asked Waylon Marsh, “May I see your wallet?” Waylon complied and removed the wallet from his back pocket. Juliet noticed that it was an expensive wallet, made of rich leather and containing various plastic windows to carry credit cards plus a zipper compartment for concealing large bills. Handing it back, she gave Waylon a compliment. “That’s a very nice wallet, Waylon.” She then asked, “Do you have coins in your pocket?” Waylon replied, “Yes, but only nickels and pennies.” Pausing for a moment, she continued, “I know who our secret tither is.” Who is the secret tither?",

        "question": "Robert Caldwell always looked forward to the fourth Monday of each month. This was when the Mystery Club of the Caldwell and Zielny law firm met to discuss the next mystery challenge. The club was made up of himself, his partner, Peter Zielny, and several young attorneys who were salaried employees. This month, it was Robert’s turn to come up with a mystery challenge. As there were now six members within this group of mystery lovers, Robert knew that he would not have to do this again for several months. So, as his fellow group members entered the firm’s spacious conference room for the meeting, he was pleased with the mystery he had devised for this month. Robert greeted each member warmly with a smile and firm handshake. Coffee, soft drinks and club sandwiches awaited them as the meeting began. He began by saying, “For this month’s mystery challenge, we are going to do something different. We’re not going to participate in a whodunit, as we often do. And we’re not going to discuss a true crime mystery. Rather, this month we will act out our own mystery study right here in our own office.” This captured the attention of the group. Ronald Finch, the youngest and newest employee of Caldwell and Zielny, asked, “So what are we going to do?” Robert smiled. “One of you is going to deposit an item within lockbox 100.” Everyone knew what Robert meant when he mentioned lockbox 100. Within the offices of Caldwell and Zielny, which took up an entire floor of a downtown high-rise office building, there was a commercial vault with safe deposit boxes. The vault in the law office was not as heavy or secure as one would find in a bank, but it was larger in size. Many of the firm’s clients preferred to store valuable legal documents there. “Now, all of you know that the vault is in view of my office. The only thing is -- I can’t see everything inside of the vault because of the narrow doorway. Box 100 is on the left, out of view, and currently vacant. The mystery challenge is this: One of you must place the item within lockbox 100 during working hours when I am in my office. It must be done before close of business this Friday. It will be for you to decide who will do this and the challenge is for me to determine, by our next meeting, who has placed the item in the box.” Russell Winwood, an attorney for the firm who was scheduled to become a full partner within the next few weeks, asked, “What is the item?” “The item can be anything you can fit into the box,” answered Robert. “In case you don’t know, box 100 is a four inch by six inch box – and you are aware that our vault contains boxes as small as 3 x 5 inches and a couple as large as two feet by three feet – safes within a safe where we can store a client’s larger valuables temporarily.” “Anything else we should know?” “The only other requirement is that the chosen person must leave his name written on a piece of paper with the item for verification. Once more, the person placing the item must do it when I am in my office, so that I may see him enter and exit.” Robert placed a lockbox key on the table and said, “Here is the key to box 100. Before leaving, determine the item and the person for our mystery. The challenge starts tomorrow when I arrive for work.” The next morning was Tuesday, so Robert knew that one of his friends would be placing the unknown item into lockbox 100 before close of business Friday. He settled on this mystery in part because he had a light workload and would be able to monitor closely who entered the vault. As you would expect in a busy law office, all of the attorneys entered the vault for one reason or another several times during the week. By 6:00 p.m. Friday, the office had cleared out and he mentally recapped several of the week’s observations. Robert’s full attention was on the mystery. He thought, on Tuesday, Peter had entered the vault with a client. The client’s lockbox was one of those on a sidewall not visible from the doorway and Robert’s view. The client carried a vanilla folder with papers inside and Peter was coatless, carrying only the firm’s key to the lockbox. Later on Tuesday, Robert had seen Edward Frates enter the vault. Edward carried a big duffel bag with him, and upon leaving the vault, he carried only a pencil in his right hand. Robert reflected that on Wednesday, James Madigan entered the vault with a client. His telephone rang as he was observing them and he took his eye off of the vault for a few critical moments. When he looked back up, James and the client were exiting the vault. On Thursday, Robert recalled, as he sipped on a Coke and snacked on peanut butter crackers, Ronald and Russell had both been in the vault. Just after lunch, Russell had approached the vault with Jane Arens, his administrative assistant and asked her to wait at the door while he entered. Russell had his suit coat on and carried a briefcase. While watching the vault, Peter had come to the door of his office and asked a question about a pending legal case. They finished their short conversation just before Robert saw Russell leave the vault with Jane. Ronald had visited the vault later in the day, shortly before closing time. He was alone, and turned right when in the vault, removing himself from Robert’s view. He was in there a long time but finally exited a few minutes after closing time. Robert made a mental note to ask Ronald what he was doing in there so long if he were not the person placing the item. Robert sat at his desk quite a while recalling what he had seen during the week. As he chewed on his last cheese cracker, the answer came to him. Smiling to himself, he knew he was ready for the next monthly meeting of the Caldwell & Zielny Mystery Club. Who placed an item in the lockbox?",

        "question": "Autumn was in the air as Gary Patrick spoke to his advanced history students. It was week three of the fall term, and it was time to share an interesting story with them. Several of his students were familiar faces that had been in his basic class last spring. Gary was especially pleased that his two most gifted students from the spring term, Justin Miller and April Park, were with him again. He remembered how much they enjoyed hearing of his great-grandfather Tom Patrick’s experiences in a northern prison during the Civil War. Mr. Patrick also wondered if April would once again be able to solve the mystery he was about to put before her and the others in advanced history. At this moment, he was pleased he had decided to delay retirement for another year. Looking at April, Mr. Patrick said to his students, “I’m going to tell you a story. It is recent Patrick family history and a true story.” When he said this, he saw Justin’s eyes widen and an intense look cross April’s face, for they remembered well how interesting the story of Mr. Patrick’s great-grandfather was. The students sensed the upcoming drama and the classroom fell silent. Mr. Patrick continued, “The time is July, 1933. The place is Shawnee, Oklahoma. Those of you who were with me last year know that my great-grandparents Tom and Marie Patrick lived in London, Arkansas. After the Civil War, Tom’s brothers spread out to Oklahoma and Texas. This story is about my uncle John Patrick, who moved west to Oklahoma in the 1890’s and settled in an area of what became the city of Shawnee.” “My cousin Johnny Patrick still lives on the farm that Great Uncle John established just before the turn of the 20th century. It plays a major part in the story I am about to tell you.” “The 1930s were hard years for the United States but were particularly harsh for persons living in Oklahoma. The drought and high winds created what is known as the ‘Dust Bowl” and destroyed the crops and livelihood of many farmers, Uncle John included. The economic collapse created widespread distrust of banks and other financial institutions, for there were few government programs to insure assets or assist persons in need during that time. It took President Roosevelt’s New Deal awhile to get into full swing and in July of ’33, he had only been in office a short time.” Mr. Patrick paused, waiting for questions. There were none, so he continued, “Because of the public distrust many families, especially those living in rural communities on farms and homesteads, simply hid or buried things of value, even money, somewhere on their property. Even today, you will hear the occasional story of valuables being found unexpectedly on an old farm or residence. Hiding treasured belongings is what Uncle John did with just about everything of value he and Aunt Jean had during that hard first summer of the Roosevelt administration. He hid his assets and, like most persons of that era, did not tell anyone besides Aunt Jean he had done so.” “So, to the point of the story and the little puzzle I have for you. A couple of months ago Johnny decided to tear down the old barn. It was built in 1912 and was in pretty bad shape. In mid July, I traveled to Shawnee and spent several days helping him. One morning we discovered a tiny marker on the barn wall near the floor and in the far corner. It indicated that a metal box was buried just underneath the ground line underneath the floorboard at that spot. As you may imagine, we were intrigued and hurriedly ripped up the rotten wood flooring and quickly unearthed the box.” “The box was what old-timers used to call a ‘strongbox.’ It was obviously homemade and made entirely of steel with leather straps around it. As you may imagine, the straps were mostly rotten and the box itself was covered with rust, but otherwise it was in very good condition for something that had been in the ground for decades. We would soon find the contents of the box were dry and well preserved. It had a padlock on the hasp but both were so rusty that it took Johnny little effort to snap the lid open. When he did so, we found something of great value.” Mr. Patrick paused. This time, he did not continue until April asked, “What was in the box?” Mr. Patrick smiled, “That is the puzzle. I’m going to give you some clues and you will have to figure it out.” Mr. Patrick was pleased. He saw that he had the students’ full attention. He resumed by saying, “Now, let me back track a little bit. Tearing down the old barn was only part of a cleaning up project. Johnny and his wife Nance had been doing some remodeling in the main house as well. About a month before Johnny and I found the buried strongbox, Nance was cataloguing some old recipe books, which were kept on a shelf above the washer and dryer in the laundry room. Within one of those books was a yellowed piece of paper dated April 27, 1932. On this piece of paper was written a list of family valuables. The list included five items. The items were a diamond necklace, several pieces of paper Confederate States of America, (or CSA), currency, a rare lithograph photo of Tom and Marie Patrick, a money clip made of gold and a pistol encrusted with rubies and emeralds. Johnny said that the diamond necklace no doubt belonged to Jean and the other things were John’s. He thinks John got the pistol and money clip when traveling with a Wild West show in the early part of the century.” Justin asked, “Were all of the items found in the strongbox?” Mr. Patrick smiled and replied, “No, only one. That is the puzzle. When I finish the story, you should be able to figure out which item it was. Now, listen closely.” “After opening the strongbox, we took it inside the main house to the kitchen table for closer inspection. On the inside of the box lid the date, “May 4, 1932 was scratched. Evidently, Aunt Nance’s list detailed the items to be placed in the box Uncle John was making for the purpose of safekeeping. For some reason, only one of the items was found in the box. This was a mystery to both of us but over the course of the next few days we discovered why.” “The next day, Nance found one of the items in an old ice box in the main house basement. In those days, it was common for people to store paper documents such as stocks, bonds, legal papers, etc., in iceboxes and refrigerators to safeguard against fire.” Mr. Patrick was quietly amused when he noticed one of his new students about to say something but decided against it. He continued, “A couple of days later, in the middle of the morning Nance again found another of the valuables, this time in the library and in a hollowed out book on the top shelf. This was another common practice in those pre-World War II days. Normally, you would hide things, especially dangerous objects you wanted to keep away from children, inside such a modified work – and the bigger the book, the better! It helped if it was one of those large leather works with a small lock and key hasp on it, but then you would have to ruin a very expensive work of art and literature to use it as a makeshift safe.” Mr. Patrick paused to let his last statement sink in. After a moment, he continued, “That afternoon, the busy Nance found another of the items. It was found in a storage box, deep in the basement storage closet. With this item there was a lock of hair, a brooch and a hairbrush with a silver backing.” Looking at Justin and April, Mr. Patrick stated, “I believe we learned in one of our lessons last year that women of that era and before kept locks of hair as keepsakes with their other items of jewelry.” “Finally, just before I was to return home, Johnny and I cleaned out what appeared to be an unfinished room upstairs. When we were about half done, we realized it was not an unfinished bedroom but an abandoned walk-in closet. This was not too surprising as it sat right off of Uncle John’s study. The item in question was found in an inlaid box full of masculine accoutrements. Among other things, it contained a tobacco pouch, a cigar lighter and the usual assortment of suspender buttons and cuff links.” Mr. Patrick paused but resumed before any of his students could speak. He said, “I have given you four clues. You should be able to determine what was in the strongbox by process of elimination.” Mr. Patrick left the classroom for a few minutes. Before departing, he said, “I would expect you will have the correct answer when I return from the office.” What item was in the strongbox?",

        "question": "Erik’s friends began showing up for the backyard sleepover late in the afternoon. It was spring break and unseasonably warm – perfect weather for spending the night outside. Martin, Justin, Trevor and Stephen had been Erik’s best friends since grade school. They took turns spending the night in each other’s homes and, during the spring and summer months, would often engage in these all night camp outs. Tonight, the first sleepover of the year would be in Erik Taylor’s backyard. While Erik’s mother, Jenee Taylor, grilled hamburgers for the boys on the huge commercial grill beneath the covered patio, Erik began to feel nervous. He was hosting tonight’s party, and he would also be the one to solve a mystery perpetrated by his friends. After dark, one of his friends would pull a practical joke on him. Tomorrow morning, he would have to figure out what the joke was and who had been the prankster. But, for now, the friends enjoyed hamburgers and soft drinks. Erik, a skilled guitar player, serenaded his guests with favorite ballads until darkness overtook the backyard. After visiting under the moonlight until midnight, the boys began to think about breaking up for the night. Each boy had his own pup tent in the Taylor backyard. The tents were arranged as a backfield formation on a football team using the old split T offense. Erik’s tent was in front, perhaps 20 feet in front of the patio. The remaining four tents were set up in a straight line in back of him, the top of the “T,” out of his line of sight and approximately 20 feet back. As the boys prepared to call it a night, Erik reviewed the rules of the game for them. “We’ve been doing this long enough that I shouldn’t have to review the rules, but I will anyway. After we say goodnight, each of you may leave your tent once before sunrise. I may observe what you do from my tent, but I may not leave it.” Erik paused for a moment and then continued, “As you know, our backyard is very dark. There is a faint night light on the patio and there is just enough light from the streetlamp in front of our next door neighbor’s house to be able to see movement back here. It is up to me to stay alert and be able to figure out tomorrow morning what the stunt is and who did it.” The boys grinned, said goodnight to each other and headed towards their respective tents. About an hour later, Erik heard an almost inaudible noise. He looked out the flap of his tent and saw one of his friends softly open the patio door to go inside, probably to use the restroom. He could not tell who it was; his clothing was as dark as the night. However, even in the dim light he noticed his shoes were lighter than the rest of his clothing. A few minutes later, the patio door opened and the dark-clothed friend was careful to return to his tent by walking in the shadows of the stockade fence surrounding the Taylor backyard. Once he had stepped in back of Erik’s tent and line of sight, there was no way to tell who it was. Less than an hour later, Erik heard another faint noise. This time, he saw a figure step out of the shadows and onto the patio. Even though this person appeared to be wearing a white pullover shirt, he could not tell who it was because of the darkness. He did see a silhouette of a person pouring a glass of water from the picnic table and drinking it. Again, the mystery person escaped to the shadows and got behind Erik before he could identify him. Later on, around 3:00 a.m. Erik heard a faint rustling noise coming from the patio. He had dozed off and barely caught it in time. Looking out the tent flap, he saw a shadowy movement on the patio but could not determine who it was or what the figure was doing. Erik thought that, whoever it was, he was good: disciplined with quiet patience. Had he not been expecting a prank, he would never have suspected anyone in the group was up and about, much less moving around on the patio. He was sure though, that it was this unidentified friend who was pulling the prank. This prankster was away, hidden in the shadows, far longer than any of the others. Finally, Erik saw the grayish black outline of his friend creeping along the fence back to his tent. Erik knew there would be one more disturbance before daylight. Sure enough, around 4:00 a.m. Erik heard the now familiar slight rustle of a pup tent flap. As the last night- walker came dimly into view, he saw that he kept within the fence shadows as the others had, but went towards the fence gate, opened it and exited the backyard. A few minutes later, the gate reopened and the unknown chum re-entered the backyard, returning to his tent as the others had. Erik thought he saw the brief glint of a pair of eyeglasses on this person’s forehead. As Erik knew all four of his friends had taken turns outside of their respective tents, he now relaxed and decided to get a couple of hours sleep before breakfast.   Around 8:00 a.m., Jenee fixed pancakes for the boys on the outside grill. It had not taken Erik long to figure out what the prank was. His guitar was missing from its stand on the patio. Now, all he had to do was figure out who took it. There was not much discussion during breakfast. The boys were tired and hungry. It gave Erik time to think through what he had seen – and not seen – during the long dark night. Biting into a piece of bacon, he noticed that Martin was wearing a new pair of athletic shoes. Grass stains had spoiled their pristine newness and added a green tinge to the bright white leather. He also considered it odd that Stephen wore a sweat suit this morning even though it was already warm. It was not just any sweat suit. It was very expensive nylon with matching pants, a windbreaker and white shirt, all sporting the maker’s logo. His mind was racing now. Erik knew that Trevor and Stephen wore contact lenses and Justin wore glasses. As the boys finished breakfast, Erik seriously considered the situation. Think, Erik, think, he said to himself, as he knew his friends would shortly be eager for him to guess which one of them took his guitar. Erik considered what he knew about his friends, hoping he would think of something to help him solve the mystery. He recalled that Trevor was a duck hunter, used to long periods of minimal movement and silence when stalking his prey. As he studied his friend’s faces, it came to him. Without waiting for his mother to leave them, he said, “I know which one of you took my guitar.” Who stole the guitar?",

One brave man -- let's call him Nate\nTold the settlers to wait. \"If we stay here and survive,\na militia will arrive. \"It's exciting that we see,\nThat we are now living free But those Tories wish to end it.\nWe'll stand tall now, and defend it.

Tories shot the fort's wood wall.\nStill its gates were strong and tall. \"They'll have allies,\" Nate describes,\n\"living in the nearby tribes.\" Indians who long resented\nchallenges Nate's friends presented fought the former colonies\nto stop them from being free.

Past the walls, the forest sounds,\nfell silent to bullet pounds. \"Still this fort's walls will protect us\nfrom the Tories who'd eject us.\" Nate knew everyone inside\nwould have no place else to hide. It was dusk now. Still alone,\nhearing Tory rifles moan, Nate's eyes scanned their wooden shell.\nAs outside the gunshots fell. To his horror, on one wall --\nsomething could destroy them all. Where the wooden walls were stocked,\none strong gate had been unlocked! His strong knot had been undone.\nWho has done this? Who's the one? Quickly Nate retied its knot.\nStill outside, more guns were shot. He'd investigate this breach,\nseeking what its clues would teach. \"I tied rope there,\" he'd decide.\n\"Someone left this gate untied. If attackers found that gate\nOur defense would be too late. Round the men up -- there were four\nwho'd stood guard beside this door.\" One of them had told a lie.\nInside was a Tory spy! \"Is it you?\" Nate asked the first.\n\"Leaving us to face the worst?\" It's a frontiersman named John,\nwho'd watched till daylight was gone After Nate's first knots were tied\nlate that afternoon inside. John came forward, thin but proud,\nspeaking in a voice quite loud, Answering, his voice excited, \n\"I know we will stand united.\" John said he'd seen knots that day,\nand they hadn't gone away. \"Though my wife -- as it grew late -- \nstood my last hour at the gate.\" John's wife nodded. \"This is true.\nI saw several knots there too.\" \"It was just an hour, though.\nAfter that, I'd had to go. I could see the new moon climb.\nIt was just past supper time.\" Nate confronted suspect three,\na young man from Tennessee. It's a teenager named Bo.\n\"That's untied? I didn't know. As I started, it grew late. \nSoon I couldn't see that gate! I'd assumed the gates were closed.\"\nNate searched in the eyes of Bo's. \"Was it always in your sight?\nDid you watch it through the night?\" \"No,\" said Bo. \"No, just, till two.\nThat was all that I could do.\" \"Please,\" said Bo, \"I'm just a peasant\nSleepiness was so unpleasant. Usually I work by daylight\non my farm, and sleep by midnight! I've worked hard to till the land.\nSee these fingers on my hand?\" Bo's left hand was badly crippled.\nThrough its skin, sore bumps were rippled. Though he'd work his farm till night\nhe'd hoe dirt with just his right. The fourth guard was Nathan Drew.\nTo this village he was new. But he'd sought the company\nof those men who would be free. Men who glowed with freedom's light,\nstanding by them in their fight. He'd been the relief for John,\nand had guarded them through dawn. All the night, as hours passed\nand they heard each Tory blast, He'd stood sentry by the wall,\ntrusted to protect them all. \"For us all, I'd risk my neck.\nUntied knots? I didn't check.\" But now Nate surveyed the four,\nchecking what he'd thought before. \"England will no longer rule us.\nBut one liar tried to fool us.\" Summoning a final clue,\nhe revealed what he knew. \"My knots are tied very tight.\nIt could take you through the night To untangle what I'd done\nWhile you hid from everyone. Now I can unmask the spy \nwho stood here and told a lie!\" Where the Tories' fight was blocked\nwho had left their gate unlocked? Which suspect had told a lie?\nWhich suspect's a British spy?

        "question": "Melody Kairns was usually the first person out of bed in the mornings. However, on this cool, spring morning in Oklahoma, she was still in bed at nine. All others in the Kairns household slept late that day, so they would say, and did not notice Melody’s absence from the kitchen until Nancy, the last person to arise, voiced her concern. It fell to Vernon, Melody’s husband of twenty-four years, to return to the bedroom and check on his wife. He found Melody, a handsome woman of forty-four years, dead and mostly unmarked. The only noticeable evidence of foul play was a small, round head wound near her temple, crusted over with a small amount of dried blood. She looked like she was peacefully asleep, which Vernon considered was quite unlike her, as she was usually a noisy, restless sleeper. Vernon, before allowing himself to go into panic, felt her cold wrist. There was no pulse—it was evident she had been dead for several hours. The coroner would later say that she had been dead for approximately seven hours, placing the murder at sometime around two in the morning. Mercifully, the murder weapon, later discovered to be an ice pick, missing from the kitchen, killed her quickly. There was no blood on Melody’s body or bed sheets. But the case stumped the family and police. Several weeks passed, and spring gave way to a hot summer. Vernon invited his sister-in-law Constance, a widow who lived in Texas, to visit for the first time since her sister had been murdered. Constance had been vacationing, staying with the Kairns family, the week that her sister died. She was nearly inconsolable, and Vernon sent her home soon after Melody’s funeral. Constance had little use for Vernon, whom she suspected of womanizing and felt didn’t apply himself to his career and family as he should, but she appreciated the chance to see her niece and nephew again, her last connections to her sister. She and Melody had been close when they were children, even with a seven-year age difference. They had shared a bedroom in their family’s small, east Texas farmhouse when growing up, and also shared all of their hopes, dreams and secrets. Constance recalled those days with fondness but did not entirely miss them, for Melody suffered lifelong sinus trouble and snored loudly, making sound sleep impossible for her until the day she was murdered. That Constance had extremely sensitive hearing only made matters worse, as she, too, experienced lifelong sleeping problems. Still, they had been more than sisters; they were soul mates. Melody’s death had been extremely hard on her. The morning she arrived, just after breakfast, Vernon gathered all of the family into the spacious den. It was the first time since that horrible day they had all been together in one room. After a few minutes of awkward small talk, Vernon cleared his throat and stated, “One of us murdered Melody.” He could barely utter the words and hated what the children must be thinking and going through. But, the police were stumped by the case, and it was apparent that they would get nowhere in the investigation unless one of the family remembered a detail about the night they’d previously forgotten. Vernon explained that the police had encouraged him to bring them together to talk about Melody’s murder again, with Constance present this time. He was not really confident any of them would remember something previously overlooked, but wanted to give it a try. He then asked, “Did anyone see or hear anything out of the ordinary the night she died?” The Kairns house was a big two story and well insulated. Sound did not carry well in it and Vernon was not surprised when nobody replied in the affirmative. John said, “I came home around midnight; I had been out with friends. All the lights were out and I assumed everyone was in bed. I went to the den and watched TV. It must have been three or so before I went upstairs to bed.” Nancy offered, “I was on the phone in my room, with the door closed. Beth and I didn’t quit talking until two-thirty or so.” Nancy gave her father a guilty look, as she knew he disapproved of her late night calls with her talkative best friend Beth Jameson. Vernon then turned to Constance. Barely hiding his animosity, he asked, “And what about you?” Constance smiled thinly, and answered, “I went to bed before midnight and didn’t see or talk to anyone again until next morning. She paused, and then said to John, “I thought about coming downstairs to watch television with you, but I could tell that you were watching one of those Friday the 13th-type movies. You all know how I hate violence with guns and knives.” Turning to Vernon, she said, “I didn’t hear anything from your room all night long.” Constance and Vernon looked at each other. Icily, she asked, “So what about you?” Vernon replied, “I went to bed at eleven-thirty. I vaguely recall hearing John come in downstairs as I was drifting off to a deep sleep. That’s the last thing I remember before awaking the next morning.” He shook, and his voice cracked when saying, “I didn’t notice anything wrong when I got up. I’m always groggy before morning coffee.” Nancy asked her father, “You don’t really believe John or I killed Mom, do you? She nervously glanced at Constance and said, “Sorry. I didn’t mean to imply you killed Mom.” Nancy’s cheeks were rosy red from embarrassment. Constance answered, softly, “Don’t worry about it, dear. I know what you are going through.” Vernon appreciated his sister-in-law’s gentling handling of his troubled daughter, but that did not stop him from saying, “You are the only one who cannot account for your presence during the window of time Melody … left us.” He could not bring himself to use the word “murder” again. Constance thought a long moment, sadness washing over her as she looked at Vernon and Melody’s sweet children. Before speaking, she silently cursed, “Oh, how I hate it’s come to this!” But then she spoke, saying to all of them, “No, I cannot account for my time. I don’t have to because it doesn’t make any difference. The game is up.” Who is the murderer?",

        "question": "The Midwestern States Car Club was huge, boasting over 200 members throughout a five state area. Gary, Ben, Gerald, Mike and Tommy all lived in the same town and had been good friends for over 20 years. They, with their spouses, met often to talk about classic automobiles. The club’s yearly convention and auto show was to be in Springfield next month. And on a beautiful spring evening, the friends met at Ben and Debbie’s home for dinner and conversation. They had much to talk about, as all 10 of them planned to attend the out of town convention. But, Ben had more on his mind than the upcoming convention. He was troubled by something that had happened at the meet last year. Tonight, he would share his concern with the group. After dinner, which had been hamburgers charcoaled on the Hamilton’s outside patio grill, Ben sipped on a Coke and said, “Someone in our group put a dent in my Corvair’s door at the meet last year. I know who it was but have hoped all of this time that he would come forward and admit it.” Ben paused, measuring his words carefully, and then continued, “It was on the lower portion of the door and not a serious dent. It was easily repaired, but it kept me out of the competition for Best Restoration.” Everyone, including Debbie, went silent and looked intently at Ben. Ben owned a 1964 Corvair Monza. One of the first American compact cars, it was air cooled with its engine in the rear. Ben’s was a beautiful automobile, which had been restored to pristine condition. It was painted sea green and sported red line tires. It sat low to the ground, which assisted in keeping it stabilized for safety. Rolling (the Corvair had a high center of gravity, causing it to tip over and roll when turning swiftly at high speeds) was the main issue with the Corvair and had been publicized by a well-known consumer advocate, sounding its death knell to the American public. Ben had made certain this issue was addressed with his Monza. Ben surprised the group again by telling them that a week after returning from Springfield last year, he had received an anonymous gift of $250 via money order and an apology for the dent mishap. He knew the unknown offender felt badly about his mistake but did not wish to own up to it. “Still,” he told them, “this needs to come to light. We are all friends here and I wish for us to remain so. I know the person who sent the money order has felt terrible all year. It’s time to address this and get it behind us.” Tommy Flowers, the owner of a beautiful yellow 1968 Ford Mustang coupe with wide oversize tires, 302 engine, four on the floor transmission and the most emotional of the friends, asked pointedly, “I didn’t know anyone had dented your car. Who was it?” Slowly, Ben answered, “I’m not ready to say. I’m going to explain what happened and see if you can figure it out. I would rather you tell me. I do not wish to accuse an old friend unless it is absolutely necessary.” Gary Riggs, the proud owner of a 1959 Chevrolet Impala four door with pronounced tail fins, offered, “We all remember that you pulled out of the judging, but you never explained why.” Doc McCroy, the owner of a vintage low slung 1966 Chevrolet Corvette Sting Ray with 427 engine, wire wheels and removable hard top, wasn’t happy either with Ben’s words and said, “OK, Ben, you began this discussion. Start explaining.” Ben replied, “It was Friday afternoon before the judging on Saturday. I drove over and parked in front of the park pavilion. I went inside to get a Coke from the snack bar. My cell phone rang and I hung around inside for a while. When I came out, there was a nasty dent in the passenger side door. I would have missed it, but the entrance to the pavilion was to the right of the Corvair. I saw it when I came out of the building.” Mike Benson, the least emotional of the friends and owner of a red 1967 Mustang coupe with a black vinyl interior, six cylinder engine and automatic transmission, asked, “Did anyone come in or out of the pavilion while you were there?” “Not that I noticed, but for a short time I was engaged on a business call and was preoccupied.” “So, you didn’t see anyone?” “That’s right,” answered Ben. “Were there any paint scratches on your door?” “No. It looked like they had been wiped away.” Ben was silent for a moment, and then offered, “There was some fresh oil in the parking place next to me. I saw tire tracks. There was nothing unusual about them except that I noticed they were very close to the Corvair.” Doc asked, “Did you notice anything else?” “No.” Everyone sat in silence for a long awkward moment. The wives said nothing, knowing this was something the men would have to work out. Debbie silently prayed that her husband knew what he was doing. Gary finally said, “OK. We need to figure this out. This is disturbing, but you are too old a friend to make this accusation lightly.” Debbie said, “When you went to the pavilion, I went with the Riggs to the grocery store. We picked up some chips and Cokes for the snack supper.” Debbie managed a weak grin and said, “Riding in a 1959 Impala is a lot roomier than the Corvair.” Tommy looked at Ben, asking, “May I ask a couple of questions?” “I wish you would,” replied Ben. Looking at Doc, Tommy asked, “Where were you that Friday afternoon? “I was washing and waxing the ‘vette.” Turning to Mike, Tommy asked, “What about you? As I recall, you were not at the judging either. Why not?” “Well, I had a radiator leak. Most of you know that cooling systems were and remain the Achilles Heel of the 1960s model Ford Mustangs. I was leaking all the way to Springfield and simply could not get it repaired in time for Saturday.” Tommy considered this for a moment and then said to the group, “I know who did this. Why don’t you admit it now before somebody has to accuse you?” Who is responsible for the dent?",

        "question": "Bill Morris was in an expansive mood after the fine dinner we had just enjoyed. After the dishes were cleared, we sat by the fireplace. His eyes showed that he was far, far away. We were old friends, he and his wife Susan, and Mary and I. Mr. and Mrs. Tom Johnston, if you want a formal introduction. “It happened during our trip to Scotland last fall. We were anxious, Susan and I, to enjoy ourselves during this long-planned trip. So much so that when the recession hit, and things were a bit tighter than usual, we decided to go regardless. We knew that the money we spent would leave us with memories of our trip. It turned out that we returned with far more than that.” That got our attention. Mary was about to ask what had happened when Bill came out of his daydream and told the story, confidential-like. It struck me that had any strangers been present with us around the fire, the story would never have been told. “We were by the lakes, you know. Loch Lomond—that region, where there are treacherous moors as well—just like in the west of England, the Baskerville country. Yes, a man could get lost there.” We nodded, shivering a bit. “As a matter of fact, seven generations or so ago, one did!” Mary had to interrupt. “How did you find this out? And who was it?” “I followed the clues. You do so too, and see if you can tell me. But to begin with, of course you remember Susan’s maiden name, Susan Alice Macready?” Susan beamed with Celtic pride as I explained to Mary, whom I hadn’t known at the time of Susan and Bill’s wedding, “Of course! And at your wedding, nothing would do but we all wore formal Scottish attire, kilts, sporrans and all. There was a piper as well, playing as we gathered at the church.” “That’s right,” Susan said softly. “And now you’ll see, this was the trip I so wanted to take, to rediscover where my ancestor James Macready came from, so many years ago.” “It was in a little village, on the edge of the moors, quaint and folkloric in its way. It made me think of Brigadoon,” Bill said. “This was the town that James Macready had come from, so many years ago. Well anyway, we started up a conversation with the local innkeeper. We asked after the Macready family. “His answer astonished us. ‘They’re all gone,’ he said. ‘They died out many years ago. The last one was James Macready, who was lost on the moor. If you don’t believe me, take a look at our local churchyard cemetery. And there will be the records in the church office.’ “Amazed, we left the inn and walked over to the churchyard. It was just as the innkeeper had said. There were plots for a few families: Macready, Doone, Jenkins and MacGinnis. The last Macready was ‘James Macready, 1823–1844. Lost on the Moor.’ At our discovery of this grave, Susan gave a cry and nearly fainted. She had brought a copy of the family’s American genealogy, which began with the arrival of this very same James Macready in 1845. He had been born in Scotland in 1823, and died on the family farm in Pennsylvania in 1863, of wounds that he had received during the Civil War, at the First Battle of Bull Run, in 1861. It wasn’t possible that he had never come to America at all. If he had not, then just who did come and start the Macready family line in Pennsylvania?” “We stayed at the old inn, prolonging our visit, and talked with several locals with long memories. They remembered hearing the old stories from their grandparents, who had surely heard the same stories around the fireplace, like this one. The stories were memorized, with a detail or two added over the years for local color.” “Good thing it wasn’t a gas fireplace at that inn in Scotland,” I ventured. “That would upset the mood, I’m sure. Real stories require wood fires!” Mary shot a disapproving look at me, and Bill continued. “It seems that there were three suitors for a pretty—” “No, beautiful!” Susan interjected. Bill smiled. “Yes, a beautiful local girl named Lucille Doone. Whether this was the same family as that lawless one in the west of England, I can’t say. But they had something of the same rough and ready traditions. Her brother, Samuel Doone, always said that if anyone didn’t do right by his sister, that person would have to answer to him—and his hunting knife. “The suitors were James Macready, Tom Jenkins, and Jack MacGinnis. Their rivalry became well known—it was jealous and bitter. It was thought that Lucille Doone had made a choice, but if she had, she didn’t let on. Townspeople speculated that harm would come to the man whom Lucille chose, by the hands of those spurned. Rather than risk her beloved being killed, Lucille kept her own confidence. And so the mens’ rivalry continued. “Until the night James Macready was supposed to have been lost—for the locals spoke of it as though it had been no more than a week ago, and certainly within their living memory. There had been a country dance at a local farmhouse, and everyone was there. It was said that Lucille Doone would announce her choice of suitors then. The dancing to the fiddler’s tune was fast, and the time slipped by. Then came midnight, and the music stopped. Lucille Doone announced her choice—it was James Macready! “Jack MacGinnis left first. He grumbled about the lateness of the hour. He never went out without his dogs, and they could be heard barking as MacGinnis walked the half mile or so to his own farm. “James Macready left next. He was going straight over the moor, which everyone always said should never be attempted at night, it was that treacherous. But it was a full moon, and with the excitement, and a wedding now to think of, he wanted to put his affairs in order. He chastely bid Lucille goodbye and was never seen again. There was just the scarf that she had given him when she made her announcement—it was found tied to a tree branch along a pathway in the middle of the moor. That’s how the people knew what happened to poor James. “The last suitor to leave was Tom Jenkins. From the name, you will have suspected that he was an Englishman, and that he was, sure enough. Or rather, his grandparents were, when they had settled here. Now, English or not, we were told that you’d not find a better Scots family than the Jenkinses. Tom was hotblooded and a crack shot with his rifle, which he always carried with him. “Samuel escorted his sister home at the close of the dance, assuring that she made it safely. The next morning, Lucille kept waiting for her betrothed, James Macready, to call. He didn’t. And he hadn’t turned up at home, either. A search party was formed, for the daytime, of course. There seemed to be no clues for what had happened that quiet night on the moor. The search took five days, but finally, Lucille’s scarf was found and James was presumed lost. Lucille herself wore black at the funeral in remembrance of her lost love and the wedding that was never held. After a few months, Lucille heard from her aunt in Glasgow and moved there. It was said that the small village held too many sad memories for her to stay on. “That was that, except for the fact that suspicions were such that neither Tom Jenkins nor Jack MacGinnis could stay in the little town either. With Lucille gone to Glasgow, there just wasn’t any point in doing so. They did leave families here, and, it is said, wrote from time to time, but the letters were not saved, and a fire at the old library, which had housed records from the time, meant that nobody could be quite sure what had happened. “And so the legends began. And now it’s your turn. Perhaps you know, as Susan and I now do, just which man came to America under the Macready name and what happened on the Scottish moor so many years ago?” Who is this mysterious Macready?",

        "question": "One night when his little nephew and niece were too excited to sleep, Uncle Robert told them a story about a past adventure he’d encountered on the police force. He hoped that a mystery might tire them out enough to send them off to sleep. And so he gathered the children around the fire and began this story. “Back when I was a detective I once found myself in a very strange situation. We had arrested a spy in central London and knew that he was on his way to a restaurant where he would be passed a small microchip containing a lot of information via a contact masquerading as a chef.” “What do you mean, Uncle Robert?” his small nephew, Peter, asked. “A spy was to receive a special microchip from a chef. … A chef, that is, who was not really a chef. “Who was he then?” “He was a secret contact.” “Oh, a secret contact! Hmm, was he one of the good guys or one of the bad guys?” his nephew inquired. “He was one of the bad guys … working with the spy.” “Stop interrupting, and let him tell the story!” little Jane said, pointing at Peter. Uncle Robert smiled, continuing: “We knew the description that the chef had been given, and we also knew that the spy was to receive the microchip concealed in a dish ordered from the menu. It turned out that the spy’s description commented on a few physical particulars, all of which I happened to match. Since we knew the table number booked in the spy’s name, it occurred to us that I should go along to the restaurant, assuming the identity of the spy – and intercept the microchip!” “Why didn’t you just go in and arrest everyone?” Peter asked. “Well, we would have,” Uncle Robert replied, “but there was a chance that the contact would have destroyed the chip! And without the chip, there would have been no way to prove anything.” “Exactly! I could have guessed that!” Jane chimed in. “What happened in the restaurant, Uncle Robert? Tell us, tell us!” Peter said anxiously, fidgeting with his pajama sleeves. “Well, I made my way to the restaurant, which was a fancy place in Mayfair called, Foie Paux. This place had vibrant and bright décor. And in the center of the large, main room was a square enclosure where four chefs were preparing their specialty dishes. As I watched, a smartly dressed waitress cleared up the used round of red plates from the central serving area, while a waiter deposited a fresh stack of blue dishes.” “I would prefer the blue dishes if I ate there,” Billy said. Jane rolled her eyes, and crinkled her small forehead, annoyed with her little brother. She nodded at Uncle Robert, insisting that he continue. “I was surprised to find that the table had not been booked for a specific time. The spy had only stated that he would turn up at some point during the evening, and that he wished to occupy the table for 30 minutes. Thankfully, before my cover was blown, the head waiter relayed these details to me as soon as I gave my name, which I spoke loud enough for the chefs at the central table to overhear.” Jane and Peter, wide-eyed, stared up at Uncle Robert in anticipation. “As I took my seat in the restaurant, I began to feel very nervous. The first part of my mission had now been achieved: I was successfully impersonating our captured spy. But I knew that if I ordered the wrong dish, I would immediately give myself away and put my own life in danger.” “Oh no!” Peter gasped. “As I told you earlier, one of the chefs was the contact. But he wouldn’t risk making any sign to me, so I had to try and figure out which dish I was supposed to order. I was wearing the captured spy’s clothes, and before entering the restaurant I had gone through his wallet to see if it contained some clues. All I had found was an old bus ticket, a locker key and a card thanking the bearer for his donation to a charity called Vegetarian Way.” “What does vegetarian mean? Peter inquired. “Vegetarian’s don’t eat meat,” Jane answered. “That’s right, Jane. … Now, there were four dishes available that evening, each prepared by a different chef. Gianni Girodano was making Italian-style vegetable lasagna. Atsushi Nishi was preparing Japanese yakisoba noodles. Jean-Pierre Dubois was making French onion soup and Jack McDonald had prepared a traditional haggis and trimmings. Trying to act casual, I talked to my waiter about the dishes to see if I could uncover any clue to help me decide which to order.” “He said: ‘I recommend the delicious French onion soup, sir. It has been very popular this evening.’ To which I repied: ‘Do you serve the same dishes all day?’” “What did he say then?” Peter interrupted. “He replied: ‘No, sir, there is a lunch menu and a dinner menu … but sometimes if a dish is popular at lunch, we keep the chef engaged to make another session for the evening customers. This is the case with the French onion soup today.’” “I love French onion soup,” Peter added. “Well, I’ll have to make you some soon. But back to the mystery, Peter. … The Italian chef seemed very popular. He was flirting with the female customers seated nearest to the serving area as he sprinkled fresh basil across a row of lasagna’s all lined up in blue dishes, capped at the end by one in a red dish.” “Did the waiter provide more clues?” Jane asked “Yes, he did.” As I watched the restaurant, the Japanese chef tossed ingredients high into the air, catching them in his frying pan. The waiter followed my gaze and nodded in approval. The waiter said: ‘Atsushi is preparing yakisoba stir fry noodles and watching him work is a real treat. He is quite the showman, and we’re lucky to have him here as part of his world tour. In fact, this is the sixth restaurant he has cooked in today, and I believe he will have one more session before he is finished for the night.’” Uncle Robert stopped his story, and looked closely at Peter and Jane. “So, children,” said Uncle Robert, “who can tell me which chef was the contact spy?” Which chef was the spy?",

She's found the clues.\"\n\"And she's wearing pretty shoes.\" In the flowers, bunnies rose\nwiggling each pinkish nose. White fur, brown fur -- some were grey.\nThey were everywhere today! \"See these eggs that we'll be sharing?\nHiding them takes some preparing!\" said the smartest bunny rabbit.\nHe's the boss. His name is Abbot. \"Hiding well takes several tries.\nSo I teach -- I supervise!\" \"He's just lazy,\" joked another.\nIt was Randy -- Abbot's brother. Randy's grey, with silver legs.\nHe hid only dark grey eggs. He'd make jokes both dark and funny,\nlike a wise-guy Easter bunny! And when Abbot tried to preach,\nRandy found new things to teach. \"Randy, it's important we \nhide our treasures carefully.\" \"Lazy -- that's what's wrong with him.\nAbbot needs to hit the gym!\" Mary laughed, but suddenly\none bright flash whizzed instantly! Breezes brushed across her face.\nlike a rabbit in a race. \"I'm Speedy,\" the bunny said\n(Cloud-white fur and eyes of red). \"It takes work to hide those eggs\nso I exercise my legs!\" Abbot said, \"His pride's quite clear.\nHe's the fastest bunny here!\" Randy laid down six bright eggs.\nSpeedy crouched down on his legs. \"Watch him now. Each egg he budges.\nHe'll roll it with careful nudges.\" Speedy stared, as though deciding \nwhere the eggs should all be hiding. Then he yelled, \"It' so much fun.\nCount me down now. 3, 2, 1\" Poof! He vanished! Blurs of white!\nEvery egg rolled out of sight! There was grass now, nothing more.\nWhere the eggs had been before. \"Presto!\" Speedy yelled to Randy.\n\"Find them, and I'll give you candy!\" Randy grumbled, then said, \"Speedy,\nFor your candy, I'll be greedy.\" In a hole he disappeared.\nBut TWO Randys re-appeared. \"Look,\" said Randy, \"Ain't this handy?\nThis is my twin brother, Andy!\" More bad jokes, and grey fur too!\"\n\"He's like Randy. Now there's two!\" Abbot muttered, \"What a psyche.\nEverything they do alike -- Walking, talking, hiding eggs.\nAnd they both have silver legs!\" Twitching whiskers soon detected.\nFrom their hole, the two ejected, Two grey bunnies raced around\nhelping Speedy's eggs get found. But then Mary had a thought\nsomething big that she'd forgot. \"Whoops! It's Sunday. Time for church!\"\n\"Hey! Don't leave us in a lurch!\" Bunny friends all gathered round her\nSaying they were glad they'd found her. Giving her an Easter cheer, \nPromising they'd meet next year. \"Could I have a souvenir\nTo remember I've been here?\" Mary knew she had to ask it \nEying Randy's Easter basket. \"Randy is so good at finding.\nJust one egg could be reminding!\" Abbot shook his ears and said,\n\"I give flowers out instead. \"All these eggs are spoken for.\nJust for Easter. Not one more.\" Mary left their Easter-land,\nWith a lily in her hand. Empty pockets (just her keys),\nbut she still could feel at ease. Sunshine left a gentle spark \nas she strolled back towards the park. Easter morning always pleases.\nOnce she even felt some breezes. But in church this day would seem,\nas though it had been a dream. But the bunnies that she treasured\nKnew that they would be remembered. As she reached down towards her leg, \nnow her pocket held an egg! Mary didn't trust her eyes\nShe had found a big surprise. It was blue and yellow too\nJust as though its dye was new. She was touched. They didn't ignore her!\nWho had left that egg there for her? Play this special Easter game.\nFind the guilty bunny's name! Which bunny is guilty?",

        "question": "Since relating Great-grandfather Tom Patrick’s civil war story to his history class last year, Gary Patrick had become intensely interested in the Patrick family tree. Recently, with the help of an internet ancestry site, plus a few hours of a professional genealogist’s time, Mr. Patrick had discovered that the remains of one of Great-grandfather’s many brothers, Robert, was buried in an unnamed cemetery in East Texas, a few miles outside of Kilgore. Robert Patrick was, from what he had learned, not as interesting or colorful as Tom and Uncle John, another of Gary’s recent ancestors and the subject of another story which he related to his students only a couple of weeks ago. As he drove up to the old graveyard on this hot, dusty East Texas October morning, he chuckled. Gary knew this would more than likely not be material for a third story to his advanced class concerning the Patrick family. Still, he was grateful for the superintendent’s permission to allow him to be away during conference week. He chuckled again when he thought of his threat to retire if permission was denied. Mr. Patrick had purchased a new head marker for Great-uncle Robert after he learned the grave was unmarked. Robert had been a cotton farmer and horse rancher in East Texas and, as his brother Tom, owned a few horses. But, he and wife Lucille lost everything during the War Between the States and found themselves in (what would become in 1872) the city of Kilgore after the conflict ended. Robert worked for the railroad and served a couple of terms as mayor of the young city. Lucille took in sewing. Robert died in 1905 and Lucille in 1911. Once again, Gary lamented there was not much here to share with his students. Well, there may be a few things to share, he thought. The old cemetery, identified only by its address, sat up on a hill overlooking what used to be a stagecoach road but now was a two lane state highway. The cemetery used to be on land owned by a Methodist church but the church had burned down many years ago, destroying the cemetery records with it. The last person buried here, according to newspaper records, died in 1936. However, an old record from Gregg County indicated that the small cemetery was mapped with 300 burial plots. Mrs. Culverson, the genealogist Gary had hired to research Robert’s burial location, found markers on 295 of the graves. Five were unmarked but it was assumed there were deceased persons in them because the youngest marker indicated a death date of 1936. It was further assumed that Robert was buried here because Lucille’s was one of the 295 marked graves. However, all of the graves around hers were marked and none of them was husband Robert. So, Gary Patrick entered the small, modest graveyard. Most of the headstones were flat; only a few were the large, ornate ones common to the pre –World War II era. Unless you paid close attention and did not realize where you were, it was possible to forget you were in a cemetery. Only the rusty gate and deteriorated fencing affirmed that Gary was on sacred ground. The old gravel path leading to the corner where the church had been was still visible if you looked closely. After a long pause, Gary looked around for the five unmarked graves. He quickly noticed that the cemetery consisted of 30 rows of ten burial plots each. He also noted with interest that the oldest graves, marked with stones indicating death dates as early as 1843, were in the corner farthest from the church. Gary thought that was thoughtful preplanning: Begin the burials far out and work in towards the church. Interestingly enough, he found an unmarked grave in this area and he noted it as Grave no. 1. Mr. Patrick continued looking around. After leaving the area of the oldest graves, he saw that the death dates on the markers were no longer in chronological sequence. As he surveyed unmarked grave no. 2 several rows from the back of the cemetery, he noticed the graves surrounding it on all sides were marked with husbands and wives together with children on either side of mother and father. Gary soberly thought of how many persons died in childhood in previous generations, before the advent of modern medications and the medical breakthroughs of the last half of the 20th century. Close to Lucille Patrick’s marker, Gary found what he denoted as Grave no. 3. He noticed that this unmarked plot was between the markers of a man named Nelson who passed away in 1860 and a woman named Nolan, whose marker informed that she died of tuberculosis in 1872. All the marked graves in this section of the cemetery were in alphabetical order by name. Gary wondered how this came to be and why. Moving towards the front of the graveyard, the markers were obviously newer and not as soiled with 130 plus years of dirt and grime. The area Gary walked through now was toward the edge of the graveyard farthest from the church path and shaded with several gnarled old trees, just a little closer in from the 1840s markers. The unmarked grave, Grave no. 4, as he would note it, sat at the foot of one of those trees. The stones around them indicated that this area was occupied with persons of prominence. One stone indicated the resting place of a government official of the Republic of Texas. Several more were denoted as pastors of the small church which once dominated this property; still another was the resting place of a turn of the century member of the United States Senate. The final unmarked grave was found near the cemetery gate. This was perhaps the most sobering sight in a day filled with sobering sights. The stones were all of children, teenaged and younger. Upon close inspection, Gary found a weathered stone, half buried by dust and time, naming this area of the cemetery as the Orphan’s Corner. As Gary Patrick finished his inspection of the cemetery, he walked back to the trees and sat on a bench not far from Grave no. 4. Studying his notes, Gary realized there was indeed much to tell his class about the old cemetery in Kilgore, TX. Mr. Patrick was back to work the next week and he could not wait to share with his students what he had learned. Not only did he have a mystery for them to solve, but also the old, unnamed Methodist cemetery was a story in itself. Mr. Patrick related the whole story in detail. April Park, along with Justin Miller one his two star pupils, was especially interested. After Mr. Patrick finished the story with Grave no. 5 in the Orphan’s Corner, she said, “I think I can tell you where your Uncle Robert is buried.” The class fell silent as Mr. Patrick smiled and said, “Go on.” In which grave is Uncle Robert burried?",

        "question": "The sun rose as George Washington rode by – tall, proud, and respected by his men. Nate rode slowly towards him, delivering an important message from the Virginia militia. In the woods, an owl hooted as the American soldiers passed on their horses, disturbing its sleep. It was early on a hot morning in July, 1780. “The British would split our army into two smaller pieces,” General Washington was saying. “But they can't! They can't travel up the river, since we've fortified the fort at West Point.” Bright sunshine sparkled on a lake as Nate approached with his message. Like everyone, Nate revered General Washington. Nearly 6,000 British soldiers had surrendered to Washington's troops at the battle of Saratoga three years earlier. But now Nate was bringing the General bad news, and as his horse clomped up the muddy farmland road, he nervously hoped that it wouldn't make his leader angry. As Nate approached, he recognized the famous general from his blue coat and three-cornered hat. “What's your name?” the general asked. “Jate Nackson,” he said nervously. “I mean, Nate Jackson.” General Washington smiled and asked if the Virginia militia was sending more troops. “Only 200, sir.” Nate saw little hint of disappointment in the general's face. It seemed Washington's success always depended on his strategy, not his resources. But suddenly, they spotted a messenger galloping towards them on a white horse. “Sir!” the messenger shouted. “The British are planning to attack our West Point fort tonight.” “But how?” “A traitor has given them a detailed map!” General Washington was alarmed, and asked for more information. Panting for breath, the messenger told his story: “It was midnight in the woods when the British major received the map,” he said quickly. “The major hid the map in his boot and disguised himself in American clothing, traveling all night on a secret path through the woods.” A worried silence fell over the group of soldiers. “As the sun rose, he was spotted making his escape on foot. And he's traveling down this very road!” General Washington turned suddenly to Nate. “Did you spend this morning riding towards us on this road?” Nate nodded quickly. “Then you must've passed the British major. We can still capture him – if we know what he looks like!” “But General,” Nate stammered, “I passed four men on the road! Any one of them could've been the British major in disguise.” He hated to disappoint General Washington again, but unfortunately, it was the truth. “There's only one thing to do,” the messenger said. “The fate of the American army depends on it, and maybe the fate of America itself. We must identify and capture the British major – and fast.” Within minutes, Nate was galloping down the road with some of General Washington's best soldiers. But could they locate the traitor's map? Suddenly, they spotted the first traveler on the road. Nate remembered seeing this man. He was traveling fast, and wearing a heavy cotton shirt. “Good morning,” the soldiers called out. “What's good about it?” the old man complained. “This heat brings mosquitoes. I only hope I don't catch a disease!” Sweat had soaked his shirt, and mud covered his humble trousers and bare feet. The soldiers laughed politely at the man's obvious discomfort. The man said his name was Edward, and that he'd been farming the land along the road for 15 years. “And I still don't like this weather!” “Look!” said Nate, pointing to another traveler, just a half mile up the road. They had barely noticed him, since his brown shirt blended with the mud around him. Leaving two soldiers to bring Edward behind them, Nate galloped quickly towards the figure with the rest of the soldiers. They discovered a young man in a thin brown shirt and leather vest. He glared at the soldiers as they arrived, and seemed uninterested in their mission. When they asked him where he was headed, he replied: “What business is it of yours?” He seemed like the wealthy son of a merchant. “What's your name?” Nate asked politely. “Lucius,” he said, sullenly, but he was clearly angry with the soldiers. “How old are you?” “Seventeen, and I hope the British beat your army,” he declared, “and soon!” “You're supporting the British?\" Nate asked. “Lots of people do,” Lucius replied. “About one out of every six people is supporting the British. War disrupts trading. I may be only a teenager, but I know that trading is what feeds my family!” Nate could understand his bitterness. With two soldiers escorting Lucius, the men rode on. The sun was getting even hotter as they passed a wide field of wheat. But soon, far ahead, they spotted a cloud of dust on the road. Nate and the soldiers galloped faster towards the cloud, discovering it came from a trotting grey horse and its shaggy-haired rider. The man's clothes were covered with dust, which had even dirtied his long, shaggy hair. “My name's Benjamin,” the man said. “Can I help you?” he asked politely. Nate was pleased that Benjamin was much more friendly than the last traveler they'd met. Benjamin said he planned to travel the road all the way to Charleston so he could visit his nephew. “It's a long way, but I figured I'd take my time,” he laughed. “I'm going just until I can find a shady tree to eat lunch under!” It did sound like a reasonable plan. But when Nate looked down the road ahead, he thought he'd spotted the fourth traveler. Leaving two soldiers behind, Nate and the others rode their horses up the road. They were soon greeted by a young man in his twenties, walking slowly down the road. Nate eyed him suspiciously, but the man seemed friendly enough. “Hello!” he said as Nate approached. “My name's Nate.” “Well, my name's Jonathan!” He extended his hand for a hearty handshake. Jonathan had short, yellow hair, and he shielded his eyes as he looked up at Nate. The midday sun was bright, as it was now nearly noon; but Jonathan's eyes were also red, and lined with dark circles. Jonathan said he was traveling to the Virginia coast, where he hoped to find work as a sailor. “It's a hard road to travel,” said Jonathan. “But an honest road.” Nate sat on his horse, thinking about the four travelers they'd met. The American army might be destroyed unless he determined which traveler was secretly a major in the British army. As the soldiers gathered the suspects, his eyes lit up with excitement, “I know who has the traitor's map!” Who has the traitor's map?",

        "question": "Tim, the led investigator of the crash looks over the recovered wreckage. There is hardly anything to lead him to a conclusion. All the bodies show no sign of injuries and there are bones that were broken after the plane hit the water. Valerie, one of his colleagues is analysing a chunk of the door. It is charred at the edges and there is a shaving razor imbedded in to it. 'Tim, look at this. The razor should have broken but it is intact. The comb belongs to a flight attendant because no one else was sitting near enough to the door', Valerie says. I step away from the table and approach Tim and Valerie to study the evidence. It is one of the most intriguing pieces of wreckage that we recovered. No one knows why or how the razor was able to be imbedded. The force of the impact would have shattered it. 'Where was the chunk of door found?' I say nervously. I was new here and I didn't want to make myself look like I was inexperienced (although I was). I spoke as little as possible and would not touch the evidence when absolutely necessary. 'Very close to land. Only half a kilometre away'. Valerie replied. Tim wouldn't speak to me. He's never been happy when a new person comes in Valerie told me. That night, after watching Tim lock up the warehouse securely to stop intruders, I started to do some of my own work as to what happened to that mysterious section of door. Working from photographs I had secretly taken earlier, I noticed that there was some text on the white and cleaner side. After orientating the evidence, I found that the scorch marks were coming from above. There had been a fire on the ceiling. The next day, I was working with a new group of investigators. Emma, Mary and Peter. Tim was, as usual, tucked away somewhere. I talked to Emma about my findings and she was shocked. This changed the entire approach to the investigation. We talked to Tim who reluctantly agreed to investigate the fire possibility. I was overjoyed. Emma was not. Emma was always the most fun and chatty person to work with. She also was the most experienced out of our team. She looked very funny because of her completely shaven hair. She had become increasingly upset. Her husband had died just after the plane crash but she had never told anyone how he died. Mary and Peter, like me, had recently joined and didn't take the work seriously enough. Soon afterwards, Mary went home and left for her one week vacation. I told Peter about the my fire idea and Peter agreed with me but only because he had absolutely no skills whatsoever. Tim didn't trust him and never told him anything that the others didn't know. His access was restricted and he was not given the passcode We continued with our work and found nothing else to form a new theory. It seemed that I was right. That night, I watched Tim lock up again and returned home. I arrived at the warehouse and was greeted by looks of shock and dismay. Vital evidence had been stolen and the door with the scorch marks was among the stolen things. The thief must have been an insider because no one outside knew about the fire theory. After my lunch break, I returned to the warehouse downhearted. Emma, who I was closest to, was leaving for a better paying job elsewhere. At the end of the month, she would be gone. Before I left work that day, I heard a clatter in the warehouse and told Tim to keep the doors open for me to investigate. At the back of the warehouse I found Mary snooping around and looking at the paper records. I shouted at her and she ran. We did not see her again for half a week. Mary couldn't have tampered with the evidence, could she? She did not have authorisation to open the cabinets they were stored in anyway and but did know the passcode. She didn't have a motive we knew about anyway. I spent the next week thinking about the case and Mary. She eventually returned and we didn't speak. I was the only one to know who was in the warehouse. I took a phone call for Valerie and an on site investigator had made some discoveries. Someone had found some other piece of burning wreckage and thrown it out to sea. A villager had been bribed by an unknown person to discard the burning wreckage and not tell anyone about it. There was a body and a pack of cigarettes found very nearby, in the sea and it was Emma's husband's body. He was a flight attendant whose body had very high levels of carbon monoxide. That was what had happened to him. But the identification of the body made no difference to the case. We had confirmed that there was a fire which went undetected. Bodies had higher levels of carbon monoxide. They had been poisoned by the fire and died before the plane hit the ground. And in a flash, I knew who had sabotaged the investigation. Who sabotaged the investigation?",

        "question": "The stagecoach rolled to a dusty stop at the Wichita, Kansas station, and four more passengers climbed aboard to join Frank Clairmont, who’d boarded back at Dodge City. He tipped his bowler hat at each fellow traveler in turn: a cowboy, a sheriff, a lady and a gunslinger. Frank’s shrewd brown eyes looked over all four as they settled down onto the two bench seats that faced one another inside the stagecoach. The cowboy was short and squat, bowlegged, with a sunburnt face and neck and an amiable twinkle in his sky-blue eyes. The sheriff was large and bulky with a bushy grey mustache. He was wearing a white twenty-gallon hat and a pair of ivory-handled pistols. The lady was young and pretty, with bright red hair and flashing green eyes, dressed in a black cloak and blue dress and white gloves. While the gunslinger was a lanky man with long fingers, a wan face, and steel-grey eyes, clad entirely in black, the guns strapped to his narrow hips matching the sheriff’s in size and caliber. The driver cracked the reins and the horses whinnied jerking the stage to a start. The long, rough trip across the plains to St. Joseph, Missouri was underway. Frank Clairmont worked for the stagecoach company as a security officer. There had been a rash of hold-ups along this particular route. There had also been numerous complaints from customers about pickpockets and card sharks working the line. Passengers’ personal items had been stolen. Other passengers had been cheated at card games by unscrupulous operators. Frank glanced from face to face, but failed to recognize anybody from the collection of Wanted Posters of known bandits and confidence men and women kept back at headquarters in St. Jo. He didn’t even recognize the sheriff or the gunslinger. But that wasn’t all that unusual – men in those two professions tended to come and go pretty quickly in the Wild West. “How ‘bout a game of cards to pass the time?” the cowboy asked good-naturedly, half-an-hour into the hot, bumpy journey. Frank’s ears pricked up. The sheriff and the gunslinger’s eyes narrowed. The lady smiled demurely at the roughhewn cowhand and said, “All right.” The gunslinger instantly whipped a deck of cards out of his jacket pocket. “Any objections?” The sheriff grunted. “Fine with me as long as no one objects to me doing most of the dealing?” “Fine with me,” the gunslinger said, “I like to keep my hands free, anyway, just in case I need them for something else.” He fingered the butt of a revolver with his left hand. The lady and the cowboy nodded. Then the lady removed her cloak and spread it over the four sets of knees, as the other players crowded closer, forming a crude sort of table. She smiled sweetly at Frank. “Would you like to partake in our friendly game of cards, sir?” she enquired. Frank shook his head. “No, thanks. I’m saving all my money to buy a homestead down in Abilene.” “Deal,” the gunslinger said, tossing the deck of cards to the sheriff. The game was straight poker. Frank pushed his bowler hat down and pretended to doze off to the sway and jostle of the stagecoach. Actually, though, he was watching the proceedings and the people closely, looking for signs of cheating. He also kept an eye on the window of the stagecoach, for signs of trouble outside, an ear cocked for the thump of the guard’s shotgun up top, which would signal trouble. The card game could well be a ruse for a hold-up. But as they bounced along the rutted trail, through the shimmering grasslands, Frank didn’t detect anything untoward. The cowboy lost steadily, the lady won moderately, and the gunslinger and the sheriff traded the larger pots back and forth. The sheriff played his cards close to the vest, literally, holding them tight to his vest up by his five-pointed tin star, sinking his chin down into his chest to look them over, careful to reveal nothing. While the lady held her cards daintily up in front of her, constantly fanning them out or shuffling them around, or even fanning herself with them. The gunslinger kept his cards facedown in his lap, allowing his hands to remain free, only peeling back the top edges of the cards every so often to see what he had. The cowboy held his cards right up close to his face, like he had trouble seeing them. This also helped to keep the other players from reading his rather expressive eyes. The lady won a small pot, the gunslinger won a large one against the ever more despondent cowboy, and then the sheriff won a large one against all three players. Finally, Frank, getting bored, asked to be dealt into a hand. He scooped up the five cards with his right hand and pushed them apart with his thumb: a three of clubs, six of diamonds, ten of hearts, king of clubs, and the ace of spades. He grimaced at the so-so hand, rubbing his thumb across the face of the ace of spades. And then Frank grinned. “Hmm,” he mused, “there seems to be a small scratch on the face of this card.” With narrowed eyes that appeared ice cold, the gunslinger barked, “What’s that?” “Yes, a small vertical scratch, almost unnoticeable – unless you’re feeling for it.” Frank rubbed the king of clubs, in the middle. “And this card has a horizontal scratch on it, if you feel really close.” “You saying that somebody’s marked the cards, mister?” the sheriff growled, slowly setting the deck down. “I believe he’s saying that someone is cheating, yes,” the lady helpfully provided. The gunslinger and the sheriff’s right hands moved towards their pistols. The cowboy’s red face went almost pale, his strangled gulp sounding loud and clear in the hot, crackling air. “Somebody’s cheating, for sure,” Frank stated calmly. He raised the small Derringer pistol he’d kept hidden under the cloak with his left hand. “And I’m taking them into custody, on behalf of the Overland Express Stagecoach Company.” Who is the cheater?",

        "question": "When Madam Rosler’s priceless red diamond, the Star of Hearts, was stolen, the staff at her country house was not unduly concerned that the police could not be at the scene of the robbery until much later that day. Mr. Seppings, the butler, announced that he would take charge of things at the house and such was the faith of the household in his keen intelligence and calm self-assurance. No one questioned his instructions when he arranged for the four people suspected of taking the diamond to be assembled in the room from which the valuable item had been taken. Mrs. Rosler was away for a short hospital stay and Mr. Seppings insisted that she should not be informed of what had occurred until everything was resolved. It certainly sent an uneasy ripple of tension through the four suspects gathered in the living room when Mr. Seppings seemed so sure that the matter would be fixed and settled before the police even arrived. Only Mr. Seppings had been told of the diamond’s whereabouts, although it seemed that someone else must have discerned the hiding place. The living room cabinet, which had contained the jewel, had been found smashed open with the refreshment trolley. The cabinet stood in a corner by the window, the refreshment trolley had collided with it resulting in the colored glass shattering and no doubt revealing the diamond inside. Mr. Seppings and the housekeeper, Mrs. Smith, had gone to visit Mrs. Rosler in the hospital, leaving four workmen in charge of the house and grounds while the other staff had a day off. It was these four men: John, Horace, Lewis and Jake who were gathered together in the living room accused of being the thief. John and Jake stood next to each other on one side of the room anxiously discussing the mud on John’s boots. Meanwhile, Lewis was seated in a chair trying to keep from standing out, something his well over six-foot frame made difficult. At slightly over five feet, Horace found it much easier to shrink into the background. Mrs. Smith thought that the matter was a very clear-cut one. She pointed out to Mr. Seppings how a line of muddy footprints matching the tread of John’s boots could be seen plainly on the carpet of the living room. The footprints entered from the doorway and led up to the center of the room where the trolley had been and then out again. John insisted that he hadn’t taken the diamond but when asked by the housekeeper how he explained the presence of the footprints, he fell silent. “They certainly were John’s boots weren’t they?” Mr. Seppings said as he looked down at the wide tread, grubby working boots John was wearing and then observed the matching marks on the carpet. “I’ve had a bad feeling about there being a thief in the house since some small things went missing from one of the dining room cupboards last month,” said Mrs. Smith. “This is poor Mrs. Rosler’s favorite room, she’s usually in and out of here all day. I put a note up on the kitchen fridge at midday to say that she was gone but I didn’t speak to anyone about it. Mrs. Rosler insists on managing some of the deliveries herself so I wanted any couriers dropping supplies off in the kitchen to know not to wait for her.” Mr. Seppings then turned his attention to the sitting room window, which was standing open. “This window was in need of repair. I gave instructions that it should remain shut at all times until it was fixed,” Mr. Seppings said. “It’s broken in such a way that opening it damages the wood on whichever side it is opened from. Everyone who works here knows that if they were to open this window and so cause additional damage they could be fired. Mr. Seppings balanced on a chair and made a quick examination of the window by lightly running his fingers along the splintered outer frame while Mrs. Smith anxiously urged him to be careful. “Now Mr. Seppings, Sir, that’s six feet off the ground on the outside. If you fall, you’ll have an awful bang.” “Let me see, the window is nearly fully open and no ladder marks to be seen.” Mr. Seppings muttered to himself. “All right Mrs. Smith, I am quite finished now,” he said as he climbed stiffly down. “Now,” he commanded, “who was working where today?” After a few moments of silence, Jake spoke up. “John was working in the back yard on some loose plumbing and I was in the cellar putting in some new wiring. Lewis and Horace worked outside together. Horace and I had our break together at eleven; Lewis and John had a break together at two thirty.” “You have your breaks here in the kitchen?” Mr. Seppings asked. “Yes that’s right,” Jake replied. “Well” Mr. Seppings started, “looking at the footprints on the carpet, it is pretty clear who stole the diamond.” Who stole the diamond?",

        "question": "I was helping to clean up after the school play, “How the Scarecrow Got His Heart.” Mrs. Tillman wrote the play herself and this was the seventh year in a row that the sixth grade had put it on. Tonight's show got a standing ovation and everyone was in a good mood. \"Did you see all those people clapping?\" Eric said, as he swept up the straw that was scattered over the stage. \"I love it! I'm going to be an actor when I grow uh...uh...ah CHOO!\" \"What's wrong, Eric?\" Jenny Jackson asked. \"Is your straw allergy acting up?\" It was true. The lead actor in “How the Scarecrow Got His Heart” was allergic to straw. He broke out in a horrible, itchy rash after the first rehearsal and we had to stuff his costume with paper strips instead of straw. \"No,\" Eric said. \"I only get an allergic reaction when I touch straw.\" \"He's just allergic to work,\" said Jimmy. He was Jenny's twin brother. \"Give him a break,\" Wendy LaRue said as she struggled to move one of the big scarecrow props. \"Learning all the lines isn't exactly easy, either.\" \"I guess not,\" Jimmy said. \"It's good of you to help, Eric. I would've gone to the party with the rest of the cast if I was you.\" \"I guess I just want to spend a little more time here on stage,\" Eric said. \"Being part of the play was so much fun. I'm going to miss it.\" \"I'll miss it, too,\" Wendy said. \"But right now, I've got to go. I'm supposed to be at dinner with my parents in twenty minutes.\" We all told her to go and wished her a good time. Even with just four of us, it took almost another hour to finish storing away all the backdrops. The real work was dragging the two man-sized, straw-stuffed scarecrows out to the dumpsters. After that was done, the other three students headed home and I stayed to sweep up the stage one last time. I was about to go myself when I noticed that the big smile had disappeared from our teacher's face. \"What's wrong, Mrs. Tillman?\" I asked. \"I can't seem to find the scarecrow's heart,\" she said. She was talking about the central prop for the play. It was a cardboard heart about as big as my chest, all covered with gold foil and plastic beads. \"That's too bad,\" I said. \"But you can always make a new one, right?\" \"Yes,\" Mrs. Tillman replied. \"But this one was very special to me. I made it for the very first production and I've used it every year since. It has a lot of memories attached.\" \"I'm sorry, Mrs. Tillman,\" I said. \"Is anything else missing?\" \"No,\" she said. \"Just the heart.\" \"Well, I really am sorry it's lost,\" I said. \"It's not your fault,\" Mrs. Tillman assured me. \"You didn't take it.\" Those words got me thinking. That night in bed, my mind kept replaying that evening over and over. It was so unlikely that only one prop, which was awfully big and hard to miss, would go missing. Someone must have stolen it. But why, and how? It would have been quite a trick to sneak that thing out of the room without anyone noticing. Before I finally fell asleep, I promised myself that I would get to the bottom of the mystery the very next day. The next day was unusually warm. I wore a pair of shorts and a T-shirt to school for the first time all spring. The nice weather put me in a good mood and I was optimistic about solving the mystery of the scarecrow's heart. I caught up with the twins just before the first bell. I didn't have time to beat around the bush. \"I think someone stole the scarecrow's heart,\" I said. \"Do you really think so?\" Jenny asked. \"I do,\" I said. \"Mrs. Tillman said that the heart was the only thing that was missing. It was too big and shiny to get lost.\" \"Shiny?\" Jimmy asked. \"That prop was ugly.\" \"Yeah,\" Jenny added. \"Why would anyone want to steal that gaudy thing?\" The bell rang and we all had to hurry to our first class. As I made my way through the halls, I thought about what the twins said. Why would anyone steal that heart? I didn't see Eric until lunchtime. He was sitting alone at a table in the corner and was already done with his food before I joined him. \"You must be cold-blooded,\" I said as I sat down. \"Why do you say that?\" he asked. \"Because you're about the only kid I've seen today wearing a long-sleeved shirt.\" Eric looked down at his shirt and nodded. \"I've been hearing that all day,\" he said. I leaned in close to him and whispered because I didn't want the whole cafeteria to hear me. \"I think someone stole the scarecrow's heart,\" I said. Eric's eyes grew wide and he whispered back, \"Do you really think so?\" I wondered how many people were going to ask me that. I went through the same explanation I gave the twins. \"I see what you mean,\" Eric said. \"Do you think she's really upset about it?\" \"Sure,\" I said. \"She was really proud of how that heart has been part of the play all seven years that she's done it.\" \"Well, maybe it will turn up after all,\" Eric said. Then he scratched his arm and stood up, saying, \"I've got some homework and stuff that I need to get done. I'll see you later.\" I said, \"Sure thing,\" and he headed off to empty his tray. Eric prided himself on getting all of his homework done at school. I don't think he ever took any of it home. Wendy sat down just then. \"Where is Eric going?\" she asked. \"To do homework,\" I answered. \"That figures.\" Wendy started eating. Just like with the twins and Eric, I came right out and said that I thought someone had stolen the heart. Her eyes flicked up from her burrito and she asked, \"Do you really think so?\" I should have known she'd ask that. I held in a groan and said that I did think so and explained why. She put her fork down and looked me straight in the eye. \"Do you think I stole it?\" she asked. \"I hope not,\" I said. \"Well, I didn't.\" Her eyes dropped back down to her food and she picked up her fork again. \"Do you think someone else might have done it?\" I asked. \"Maybe you,\" she said, without looking up. I decided that she was too angry to be of much help. We finished our meals in silence. As soon as I was done, I emptied my tray in the trash and looked for the twins. I found them in the library. \"Hi guys,\" I said. \"Hi,\" they both answered at once. \"How's it going?\" Jenny asked. \"Did you figure out who stole the heart?\" Jimmy said. \"Not yet,\" I said, \"but I think I'm close. I just have one more question for you two.\" \"Okay,\" Jimmy said, and Jenny added, \"Shoot.\" \"When was the last time you saw the heart?\" \"I saw it when we were cleaning up all the other props,\" Jimmy said. Jenny thought for a moment and added, \"It was probably about fifteen minutes before we left.\" I nodded and said, \"Thanks. That was just what I wanted to hear.\" I knew who did it and there were still five more minutes left in lunch period. Who stole the heart?",

        "question": "“I wanna ride your new bike!” Mark whined. Matthew didn’t even bother glancing away from the video game he was playing with his friend, String, to look at his little brother. “Not a chance, short stuff,” he said, zapping String’s on-screen troll with a blue thunderbolt. Mark’s lower lip and chin started to tremble. “I’m-I’m telling Dad when he gets back!” the nine-year-old shrieked at his older brother on the basement couch. “He said you were supposed to share the bike with me sometimes!” “Get lost,” Matthew replied, thumbs flying, chasing String’s game ogre up a beanstalk. Mark turned and stomped up the stairs. “You gotta relax your attitude about that bike, dude,” String commented. “It’s not made of glass, you know.” “Gotcha!” Matthew hollered, lopping the head off String’s ogre with a golden sword. String threw down his controller in disgust. “But I’ll get you – you can count on that, buddy-boy.” String was so nicknamed because he was tall and skinny, and he always wore a piece of string tied around one bony wrist. He was a big-time practical joker, so Matthew didn’t take his playful threat lightly. “Another water balloon from the third floor of the school?” he asked blandly. “Or maybe another rubber chicken in my lunch bag?” String grinned evilly. “You won’t know ‘til it hits you, friend.” The doorbell rang. Matthew jumped off the couch and ran up the stairs to the side door of his home. David was out on the driveway, sitting on his bike. The three pals – Matthew, String and David – had agreed to meet at Matthew’s house, before joining their other friend, Cory, at the city park on the outskirts of town for a day of off-road biking. David looked up glumly, as Matthew opened the door and said, “What up, D-man?” “I got a flat,” the freckle-faced redhead replied, pointing at the bald back tire of his beat-up bicycle. Matthew stepped outside, looked at the pancaked rear tire. “Sure do.” Something always seemed to be wrong with David’s bike. “How’d you make it over here?” “It wasn’t bad when I left my place.” David got off the bike, dropped it down onto the concrete driveway with a crash. “Hey, mind if I ride your hot wheels over to the bike shop on the corner, to pick up a patch?” Like all of the boys, David had wanted to take Matthew’s new bike for a spin as soon as he’d laid eyes on it, and he was more than a little resentful that his friend wouldn’t let anyone even touch his cherry ride. “Uh … I don’t think so,” Matthew said. He glanced affectionately at his shiny new bicycle where it was chained up against the wall in the open garage. “Why don’t you take String’s bike? He won’t mind. Just come in when you’ve got everything patched up and we’ll all ride over to the park.” He stepped back inside the house and shut the door. Half-an-hour later, David came down the stairs and found the two boys still in the basement, still playing video games. “You guys about ready to take off?” he asked. “In a minute,” Matthew replied, sending String’s on-screen go-kart flying into a pile of hay bales and exploding in flames. “Fix your tire?” String asked. “Yeah.” David plopped down into a chair. “I used some tools in your garage, Matthew, if that’s alright?” “No problemo,” the curly haired boy responded, banging String’s flaming wreck right off the track. After another half-hour, the boys finally turned off the big-screen TV and headed upstairs and outside. “My bike’s gone!” Matthew howled, staring at the empty spot in the garage his brand-new bicycle had so recently decorated. “It was here when I got back and was working on my bike,” David said. “There it is!” String shouted, pointing up the street. “Looks like someone got to ride it whether you liked it or not.” They all stared at Mark blithely riding up the street on his brother’s bicycle, a look of glee on his beaming face. Until he saw Matthew come charging across their front lawn and out into the street. Then he yelped and jumped off the still rolling bike and ran off in the opposite direction as fast as his little legs would carry him. “How’d he get the bike unchained from your garage?” David asked, once he and String had caught up with Matthew in the middle of the street. “The punk’s crafty,” Matthew scowled, stroking the dust off his bike with a Kleenex. The boys mounted up and peddled on over to the city park. Cory was waiting for them at the entrance to the park, sitting on his own customized bike. “I got a real rough track picked out for you squirts today,” he said. The square-built blonde was half-a-year older than the rest of the boys and leader of the pack, as a result. “Think you and your precious new tricycle can handle it, Matthew?” “This baby can handle anything,” Matthew sneered back, patting his chrome handlebars. They hit the trails, bouncing up and down a set of ruts that led through the forest, peddling hard up one side of a hill and then sailing down the opposite side, yelling with excitement. They crossed a bumpy crushed rock road and rattled along an abandoned railway track before speeding over a cedar chip path back into a wooded area, laughing and shouting. David, Cory and Matthew raced out ahead of String, flying around a corner in the path and out of sight. The beanpole made no effort to keep up. A minute later, he heard a horrific scream. String sped around the corner and skidded to a stop. Matthew was sprawled out on the ground, David off his bike and kneeling next to the whimpering boy. “My front wheel came off!” Matthew wailed. He let David help him to his feet, nothing injured except his brand-new bike and his pride. Cory squatted down beside the busted bicycle and picked up two shiny metal nuts. They were the axle nuts that secured the front wheel to the front forks of the bike, and when they’d come off, the wheel had come free, pitching Matthew right over the handlebars and onto the trail. “These babies must’ve been deliberately loosened, to fly off a new bike like that,” Cory said. “Lucky you weren’t riding down a hill or something – you could’ve really been hurt.” “Sabotage!” Matthew cried. “This wasn’t one of your stupid practical jokes, was it?” David asked String. String scratched his bony skull. “What, and miss it? What’s the point of a practical joke if you don’t see it happen?” “Was anyone fooling around with your bike before you came here, Matthew?” Cory asked. Matthew sniffled, brushing off his jeans and t-shirt. “No, I don’t think …” An angry gleam suddenly shone in his watery brown eyes. “Yeah, wait a minute-” “Wait a minute, indeed,” String interrupted. He walked over to Cory and popped the axle nuts out of the boy’s hand and deftly caught them in his own hand. “I know who loosened these,” he said. “And we all know why.” Who sabotaged the bike?",

        "question": "“This is boring,” Suzie Shaw said to her boyfriend. Next to her in the front seat of his car, Dan Cartman rolled his eyes. “I told you a million times that this wouldn’t be a date, and that stakeouts aren’t as cool as the cop shows make them seem. But remember, you insisted on coming along anyway.” Suzie sighed. “I know, I know.” She smiled and playfully punched his arm. “But I couldn’t let you sit out here on the mean streets of Dullsville, Florida by yourself.” Dan and Suzie were parked at the side of the road in a nondescript suburban neighborhood on a warm summer’s night. At 7:00 p.m., all was quiet, save for the occasional jogger, baby walker or dog walker. Suzie snuggled up to him. “I know a way we could pass the time.” “This isn’t about passing the time,” Dan said. “I can’t let you distract me. This is the first case my dad’s let me handle on my own. I can’t blow it.” “I’m just teasing.” Suzie settled back into her own seat. “So tell me again why the police haven’t caught this house robber.” “They claim they don’t have any leads. Our client, Mrs. Krantz -- the first victim, a widow who had thousands of dollars worth of jewelry stolen -- insists it’s a guy named Mike Creighton who lives in the neighborhood, and she’s hired us to prove it. Mrs. Krantz says she’s kept her eye on him ever since he moved in.” “Maybe she’s just lonely.” “Maybe, but ... uh ...” A pretty blonde girl jogged toward the car, distracting Dan. And much to Suzie’s annoyance, Dan jumped out to talk to the jogger. Suzie’s window was open, so she eavesdropped on their conversation. “Excuse me,” Dan said. The jogger stopped and gave him a flirtatious smile. “Hi,” she said. “I’m Jill. Are you stalking me or just trying to get my phone number?” “What? Stalking? I, uh--” “I’ve seen you sitting in your car every night this week ...” “Oh, that, well, I’m a private detective and--” Jill smiled. “Oh, how exciting! Are you on a stakeout?” Dan grinned ear to ear, loving the attention. “Yes, I’m here--” “With his girlfriend,” Suzie said loudly as she exited the car and joined them. Jill gave Suzie a dismissive glance. “I hear there’s been a series of robberies in the neighborhood,” she said to Dan. She touched his muscular arm briefly. “But I feel much safer now that you’re on the case.” Dan cleared his throat, uncomfortable under Suzie’s piercing stare. “Aren’t you worried that your home will be robbed while you’re out jogging?” “No, I have a roommate.” “Have you seen anything suspicious while jogging?” “No, the only thing I noticed-- ” Jill smirked at Suzie, “was you watching me.” “I, uh, had to make sure you weren’t the robber,” Dan said. “Look at me,” she said. Jill raised her arms up to focus Dan’s attention on her small, formfitting clothes and her tan, bare skin. “Don’t even think about asking him to do a strip search,” Suzie said. Jill gave her that annoying smirk again. “Not tonight.” She turned back to Dan, “But maybe next time. See you around, detective man.” She jogged away. Dan watched her go and was rewarded with a not-so-playful punch in the arm from Suzie. “Ow! I had to observe her,” he said. “She could have done something suspicious.” “Uh-huh.” “Seriously. There’s definitely a connection between the walkers and joggers and the crimes. Everyone who’s been hit was out of their house for a short period of time and never went more than a few blocks away on foot.” “Does Mrs. Krantz jog?” Suzie asked. “No, she walks her poodle, and ... there she is!” Suzie turned in the direction Dan pointed. Mrs. Krantz spotted them, too, and approached rapidly. “Any leads, young man?” she asked. “Nothing yet,” Dan said, “but I am, er, watching, a few people other than Creighton.” He nodded his head at Suzie. “This is my girlfriend, Suzie.” “Hi,” said Suzie. “If you don’t mind my asking, why are you so sure this Creighton guy is the robber?” “He’s new to the neighborhood,” Mrs. Krantz said, “and he’s been out walking his dog every time a house was robbed.” “So have you ...” “Exactly! I can testify that he’s been in the vicinity of every crime. Speaking of which, I’ve got to keep moving. One of us has to catch him in the act!” And with that, Mrs. Krantz continued on her way. “Was she implying that she thinks I can’t catch the robber?” Dan asked as he and Suzie got back into the car. “No, I’m sure she wasn’t,” Suzie said reassuringly. “But her reasoning for fingering Creighton sounds pretty flimsy to me.” “Yeah, but she still convinced a cop to question Creighton after the last robbery. Under her watchful eye, the cop practically strip-searched the poor guy on the sidewalk, but all he had on him was a bag of doggy doo-doo.” Dan chuckled. “Mrs. Krantz even had the cop check the dog’s mouth.” “So why are we here again?” “Because Mrs. Krantz paid my father,” Dan said. “And if you want me to be able to afford an engagement ring for you, my father has to make me a full partner in Cartman Investigations, not just a glorified errand boy. So you better hope we catch the real thief tonight.” Suzie raised her arm and admired the sparkly gold bracelet she wore. “You didn’t have any problem affording my beautiful birthday present,” she said. “I got that from a pawn shop, if you must know,” Dan said. Suzie felt bad for embarrassing Dan, but didn’t know what to say. After an awkward silence, Dan said, “Can you keep an eye on things? I’m going to run up the street to the gas station to use their restroom.” “Okay, hurry back,” Suzie said. Nothing happened while Dan was gone, and Suzie’s boredom returned. Then, just as Dan came back into sight, a woman with a double baby stroller exited a stucco house. Dan spoke to her briefly, smiled at her twin babies, and then came back to the car. “That’s Wanda. She’s definitely not the robber,” Dan said. “Not with those two babies demanding her constant attention.” “You sure there’ll even be another robbery tonight?” Suzie asked. “There’s been one every Wednesday since they began, despite the added police patrols of the neighborhood.” A little while later, Dan suddenly pointed out the open window at a man walking toward them on the sidewalk. “Hey, that’s him!” Suzie grabbed his hand and pulled it back in. “Great P.I. you’ll make, pointing at the suspects. Real covert.” “I--” “Shut up and kiss me, silly. Or do you want him to think we’ve been sitting here waiting for him?” Dan didn’t argue. As they kissed, they still watched Creighton walk by with his dog’s leash in one hand and a stinky plastic bag in the other. Once the man was a few houses away, Dan broke off the embrace. “C’mon,” he said as he opened his door, “let’s go for a romantic walk.” They didn’t follow Creighton for long before he ducked behind some tall bushes at the side of the stucco house. “There you go,” Suzie said, “he’s going to rob that house.” Dan pointed at the ground through a gap in the bushes, where the dog was crouched, apparently doing its business. “Just giving his dog some privacy,” he said. “We’re going to have to circle the block or else he’ll notice us.” They circled the block, and as they returned to the stucco house, they saw Mike Creighton heading away from them, and they also saw Mrs. Krantz walking toward them from farther up the street. At the same time, Wanda came from across the street in front of them and went back into her house. A moment later, there came a scream from inside. Dan and Suzie hurried over. Wanda and her babies were fine, but she was on the verge of tears. “I’ve been robbed,” she said. “Someone stole my wedding ring!” “Don’t worry,” Suzie said, “I know who took it.” Who stole the ring?",

        "question": "Rubbernecking is a dangerous sport. I should know, because I just about hit a cop on my drive to the racket club. There was a traffic accident on the corner of Main and King, blocking the entrance to the Java Hut. The ornate “Open” sign inside the Java Hut window taunted me -- if I could just get past the yellow barricades, I thought. As I surveyed the wreckage, mourning the loss of my morning coffee, I almost missed the fact that the streetlight had changed from green to red. As I slammed on the breaks, with my car stopping inches from a police officer crossing the road, I knew that I was in big trouble. Fortunately, I got off with just a warning. The police officer came to my window and glared at me. “You should keep your eyes on the road,” he said. “Sorry, officer,” I said. “I’ll be more careful in the future. But if you don’t mind my asking, what happened here?” “Yes, I do mind,” he said, and strode off just before the light turned green. I resisted the urge to sneak another glance at the accident scene, but my curiosity was fulfilled later. Anyway ... when I arrived at the racket club, I felt like calling that police officer to help me out because the club’s patrons had to pay for parking, and as far as I’m concerned, that’s just criminal (especially considering that I know how much my cousin Dave Perkins paid in membership dues). And it wasn’t even a flat fee for parking, they gave you a time-stamped ticket and you had to pay for every quarter hour segment of your stay on your way out. It didn’t seem to bother my cousin, though. When I entered the club’s lobby, Dave was waiting for me on a leather couch drinking a cup of Java Hut coffee. He looked relaxed. “Don’t get too comfortable,” I said. I pointed at the clock -- it was 9:50 a.m. “Our court time is in ten minutes. And that means you’ll be losing in exactly eleven minutes ...” “Are you sure you’re up for this?” Dave asked. “You haven’t played squash in years.” “I beat you when we were teenagers, and I’ll beat you now,” I said. “Loser buys lunch,” he said. Good thing I brought my credit card. I lost -- badly -- and I had a sinking suspicion that Dave would order the club’s most expensive bottle of wine. But first we decided to hit the steam room. My aching muscles needed it. Dave’s co-workers from the Water Works plumbing company, Larry Douglas and Chris Henderson, were already in the steam room when we arrived after our half-hour session on the squash court. “I squashed Larry,” Chris gloated after Dave introduced me. “Did you take care of Dave?” “Well,” I said, embarrassed. “I, uh--” “He was off his game because he didn’t have his morning coffee,” Dave said, coming to my rescue. “Java Hut was—“ “Big deal,” Chris said, “Java Hut was closed when I drove by, too. I beat Larry with un-caffeinated skill.” “That’s because I was half asleep from waiting for you so long on that comfy couch out front,” Larry said. “I wondered why you were still in here,” Dave said. “I thought you had a 9:30 court time.” “We did, but we didn’t end up starting until 9:45. Good thing you guys booked a different court number. There was nobody on ours after us, so we played until nearly 10:30. Besides, he only beat me by--” “Never mind your scores,” said Nathan Elliot as he entered the steam room. “We’ve got more important things to talk about.” Water Works’ owner stood at the door with his arms crossed. Unlike the rest of us, he wasn’t dressed in just a large towel; he wore a three-piece suit. He looked very uncomfortable as the steam caused him to sweat instantly. But it was my turn to feel uncomfortable when he turned his focus on me. His eyes narrowed. “Who are you?” he demanded. “I’m Dave’s cousin, Rick,” I said, trying my best to sound friendly in deference to not causing Dave any problems. “I believe I took your place on the squash court today.” “That’s right,” Nathan said. “I wasn’t supposed to be here” He looked down at his suit, “Obviously. I left my niece’s wedding to fire one of you!” All three of his employees sat bolt upright, suddenly on edge. I, too, felt the stress of the situation, despite not being at any personal risk. Then again, I was at risk of passing out from too much steam. Nathan, who for all intents and purposes was blocking the exit, said, “I’m not moving until I find out who caused that accident at Main and King.” “What makes you think it was one of us?” Chris asked. “Witnesses all described our Water Works vans. No one caught the license plate, but it had to be one of you three.” “Or you,” I said. I was no longer worried about being friendly. If he was the culprit and he was trying to frame my cousin, then Dave would have a lot more to worry about than losing his job. And I have to admit, that if Dave was guilty, the thought of providing an alibi for him did cross my mind. But only momentarily. Do the crime, do the time, I always say. “I didn’t drive my van to the wedding -- while I normally love getting the company logo in front of as many eyeballs as possible, my wife would never step foot in that van in an expensive gown,” Nathan said. “What time did the accident happen?” Larry asked. “Around 9:35.” “I got here at 8:30,” Larry said, “I have a ticket on my dash.” “Did anyone see you?” Nathan asked. “Well, no, but ... why don’t you just go look at our vans,” Larry said. “Mine’s in the parking lot and it’ll be obvious from looking at it that it hasn’t been in any accidents.” “I didn’t say any of you idiots were in an accident,” Nathan said, losing his temper as his suit clung tighter to his sweat-soaked body. “One of you ran a red light. A car that had the right of way swerved to avoid you and smashed into another car. Nobody died, thank God, but I’m sure the police are going to want to talk to whichever one of you walks out of here unemployed ...” “Go ahead and call the police, I said. “I know who caused the accident.” Who caused the accident?",

        "question": "New Year’s Eve, 2009, was a night that Blake Sloan had looked forward to for a long time. Tonight, he and his wife Mary Beth would host a New Year’s mystery party. Mary Beth had first thought of this back in the summer, but it was Blake that had gotten excited about the idea. He had planned and prepared for this night since before Labor Day. The format was simple. There would be six in attendance at the party and one of them would be “murdered. There would be five clues, one pointing to each of the five “suspects”. Four of the clues would be false. The fifth one would be true and tag the “murderer.” All of their guests, which consisted of the Kings and the Wades, had arrived at the Sloan home by 7:00 p.m. The party started out innocently enough, with dinner and cocktails. Since it was New Year’s Eve, there was ample liquid refreshment but the guests had been cautioned about drinking too much because Blake wanted everyone to be able to participate fully in the murder mystery. It was understood that the mystery would begin after dinner. Blake offered an admonition, saying, “Pay close attention to everything that happens when we leave the dining room.” Mary Beth hosted an excellent meal and then invited everyone to the den, carrying a tray of various beverages. The Sloan home was a spacious two-story house with large rooms and high ceilings. She and Blake agreed that the floor plan of their home was perfect for a murder mystery party. As the guests settled into the comfortable seating in the den, the party appeared to proceed as normal. Hot coffee and brandy were served by Mary Beth, who made it a point to keep the cap on the brandy decanter, and soon everyone was in animated conversation. After about 15 minutes, the doorbell rang. Blake excused himself to answer and see whom it was, leaving his tumbler of brandy on a lamp table by where he was sitting. It was their next-door neighbors, the Perkins, wishing them a Happy New Year. Blake yelled to the others that he would return to the den in a few minutes. Just as he said this, the telephone rang. Mary Beth said, “Oh! That may be my sister Jo! She lives out of state and her husband has been ill. I had better answer in the kitchen.” In her haste, she tripped on the leg of the table where Blake’s drink sat, spilling a small amount of it on the cherry wood finish. Very quickly, The Wades and Kings were left alone in the den. They smiled in amusement, for they realized the game was underway. But, before they had an opportunity to discuss it, a loud noise came from upstairs. Mary Beth poked her head out of the kitchen and said, “That’s got to be the new mirror we installed in the game room. I hope it’s not broken! Roy, can you go check on it?” Roy, sitting right by the den door to the hallway, quickly ran upstairs, knowing it was part of the setup but still excited about what he may find in the game room. All he found was a tape recorder set to loud volume which been activated by a timing device. While Roy was upstairs pondering the tape recording and timing device, Blake returned from the front door just long enough to ask Juanita to join her husband upstairs. Juanita, excited by the game, which was now in full swing, clasped both hands tightly to her mouth as she ran out of the den to join Roy in the upper level game room. At this moment, they heard a scream coming from the kitchen. First Noel and then Theresa King ran to see what had happened. Mary Beth had fainted and fallen on the floor. The telephone was still in her hand. After a moment, she was revived and said to Theresa, weakly, “Theresa, please get me a cold wash cloth. They are in the bathroom, on the other side of the house, opposite from the den.” Now, it was only Mary Beth and Noel King in the kitchen. Noel stood by her, not knowing what to do. Mary Beth handed him the phone and said, “Please redial the number and tell Jo I’m OK.” As Noel did as Mary Beth asked, Blake said goodbye to the neighbors, returned to the den and was now alone. Seeing the splash on the table, he refreshed his drink from the refreshment table decanter and took a sip. After a short moment, he choked and lost consciousness. He was dead by poison from the brandy. The cap had not been removed from the brandy decanter since before Blake answered the doorbell. Scarcely ten minutes had passed. Blake lay “dead” on the floor of the den. Mary Beth had been “revived” in the kitchen by the Kings. They returned to the den and found the Wades just coming down from the upstairs. Once they had gathered in the den, they examined the “body”. The brandy snifter was still firmly in his grasp. At this point, Blake arose and told his guests, “I drank poisoned brandy. Who poisoned it? The murder is solved when it is determined who did it, but if you can tell me how it was done, you will be a super sleuth.” Smiling, he added, “Everyone, please take a seat and rest assured the drinks are safe. Let’s discuss who murdered me. The person who solves the mystery will receive a nice door prize.” Mary Beth and Blake’s guests were savoring every moment of the New Year’s Eve mystery and seemed in no hurry to bring it to conclusion. When Blake poured a second stiff whisky and soda for Noel, he decided they had better solve the case before further partying. He nodded at Mary Beth and she picked up on his cue, asking for silence and saying, “OK, who killed my husband?” Who is the murderer?",

        "question": "“Surprise!” Paula was startled as she walked through the door. Amidst the colorful balloons and fluttering streamers, she was, in fact, surprised. Her cheeks had already been flushed by the hot July weather. Now, her skin color was nearing tomato-red. Again the crowd shouted, “Surprise! Happy birthday!” Paula smiled. She was gleaming at her co-workers. “Thanks everyone!” she exclaimed. “It’s so nice that you guys thought of me.” “No sweat,” replied Paula’s boss, Mr. Bento. “You’re a hardworking girl who deserves to have a wonderful birthday. Except, I hope you don’t mind that there’s no cake. You know that I’m on a strict diet!” He winked at her and blew his party kazoo. “Yeah, you’ve definitely earned it,” added Luis. His warm smile caught Paula’s eyes. Paula blushed. She had always had a crush on Luis. His thick black hair formed a beautiful beacon to his sparkling blue eyes. His chin was cut to perfection and his pale white cheeks reminded her of royalty. “Gee, thanks ... I don’t know what to say,” Paula managed to stammer. “Stop wasting time already! We can’t party all day and you know it,” interrupted Julianna. Her lips curled into a sneer, “There’s work to be done, after all. So I suggest that we let her open the gifts.” The remark was cutting. Paula looked down and frowned. It seemed that Julianna’s only goal was to make sure that work was done fervently and in a timely fashion. Though she herself was small (under four feet tall), Julianna’s attitude was not. “We’ll get to work eventually,” Mr. Bento announced. He had a smirk on his round face. “But first, let’s party!” Paula shrugged and giggled as she began to unwrap her presents. She opened up a new watch, some candles, a set of dishes and an old spatula. “That spatula is going be worth hundreds of dollars as an antique some day,” said a feeble, yet excited voice. Paula turned and grinned at Geraldine. The white-haired woman smiled at Paula, revealing her pearly white teeth. “Here’s my present,” said Luis, as he placed it into Paula’s hands. “Wow! Look at the size of that cupcake. I love it! Thanks so much!” Paula gave Luis a hug, “I can’t wait to sit down and eat it.” “That’ll have to be at lunchtime,” said Mr. Bento, as he blew the party kazoo one last time. “We really do have to get a move on today’s work.” “He’s right,” said Julianna, as Mr. Bento left the room. “Looks like you’re going to have to be a responsible adult and work hard for a change.” Paula sighed. Her other co-workers helped her pick up the room. Then, Paula placed the cupcake in a paper sack, and stood on her toes in order to reach the top shelf. She put the bag up on the shelf as far back as she could reach and left the room. When noon finally arrive, Paula jumped up from her computer. Missing breakfast made working through the first shift very difficult. As a result of her hunger pangs, she briskly walked to the office kitchen with her mind set on devouring the birthday cupcake. Paula stopped. She looked down to see nothing but a few moist chocolate crumbs sitting peacefully on the table. She sighed out of frustration. Mr. Bento walked in, “Holy smokes kiddo. What seems to be the matter?” “My cupcake is gone,” cried Paula. “I’m so disappointed. Do you realize just how long I have been waiting to eat it?” “Oh, that’s too bad,” he replied. “Consider yourself lucky, that cupcake was probably over 300 calories!” Paula looked at Mr. Bento’s round belly. Her eyes seemed to accuse him of stuffing himself full of her birthday treat. Mr. Bento noticed this, “Of course I didn’t take it,” he replied. Paula thought for a moment. Then, her face grew angry. She ran to the back of the office where Julianna and Geraldine worked. Julianna didn’t even look up from her typing when Paula entered, but instead rolled her eyes. This caused Paula’s voice to erupt, “Why did you eat my cupcake?” Julianna snapped back, “I didn’t take your cupcake. I haven’t even looked up from my computer all morning. There’s work to be done and I’m much too busy completing it.” As the two rivals glared at each other, Geraldine walked into the room sipping from her coffee mug. “What’s wrong,” she asked. “Oh nothing,” replied Julianna. “Paula is just accusing me of stealing her cupcake, when she knows full well that I am way too busy with work to commit such a silly crime.” “You did too steal it,” Paula shot back. “Well, I didn’t do it either,” offered Geraldine. “I forgot my teeth this morning and wouldn’t be able to chew it! She smiled at Paula to reveal her toothless gums. Geraldine then thought for a moment. “You put it in a paper bag, didn’t you?” “Yes.” “Then, I know who took it. Follow me, honey.” Geraldine led Paula and Julianna down the hall and into Luis’s cubicle. She pointed at the wastebasket. Inside next to a few old newspapers and some used scotch tape was the brown paper bag. Paula gasped. Julianna let out a satisfied sigh. Luis, flushed and saturated in sweat, entered the room. “You thief!” cried Julianna. “How dare you eat Paula’s cupcake!” Luis looked perplexed. He quickly got defensive. “How could I have? I haven’t been here all morning. I just got back from running errands. Besides, why would I steal the present that I got for her?” Paula looked saddened and confused. All of her co-workers had an alibi, and she didn’t know who had wronged her. (… Or did she?) Who ate the cupcake?",

        "question": "“It snows and everyone becomes a kid again,” Jack grumbled. While his co-workers were leaving early or acting juvenile, he was trying to piece together his interview notes. He had spoken with the governor’s son, Elliot, about a recent academic scandal in which he was accused of cheating on his exams and helping other students to cheat as well. It would end up being a top story for The Printed Voice and he wasn’t leaving work until he had finished a draft. Amy, a childish co-worker, peeked her head in the doorway. “Jack, come out and play!” She hopped in to face him, peering over the large stack of notes that filled his work area. He grabbed two handfuls of paper and held them up. “I’m trying to work. I’ve seen snow before.” “You’ve seen snow, eh? Well, do you see my hand behind my back?” she giggled. Something cold and wet smacked Jack in the face. Recovering from the partially melted snowball, he watched Amy scamper away. As he ran out of his office, he grabbed the door handle and pulled it shut, rattling it with his palm twice to make sure it had locked. Dashing through the lobby in hot pursuit, Jack nearly collided with another reporter, Lucy, while she was coming inside the building. “Excuse you!” Lucy yelled back at him. Lucy was a bitter reporter and the office gossip. Most people tried to steer clear of her. Jack, unfortunately, had bumped right into her. Jack called back a quick apology as he continued the chase. Running outside, he stepped on a patch of ice. He found himself on the ground, looking up at the winter sky. He sat back up and saw Mr. Jenkins, the custodian of the facility, standing on the sidewalk with his trash receptacle. “Glad to see you’re finally having some fun,” he called out to Jack with a grin. “This was not my idea of a break,” Jack groaned back. Mr. Jenkins shook his head again. “Well, I mopped up the mess in front of your office just a moment ago. I feel like I have been attacking wet footprints ever since it started snowing.” Jack gave him a frown of sympathy. “Sorry. That was from Amy, not me.” Mr. Jenkins sighed and gave a shrug before heading inside. Another co-worker, Sarah, stepped out right after him and burst out laughing when she saw Jack still sitting on the ground. “This is a change of scenery for you,” Sarah giggled as she stopped in front of him. “I bet you wish you’d landed Alex’s Sea World story … you’d be enjoying the sunny San Diego weather right about now!” Still dazed, Jack wasn’t exactly paying attention. Sarah adjusted her heavy shoulder bag, and waved her hand in front of his eyes, “Hello? Is anyone in there?” “Sorry,” he said, “I’m just stressed – as usual.” “I know how that is,” she replied. “… If only my name were Lucy, then, I’d be dating the boss’s son. And, then, I’d get to do whatever I wanted.” It looked like Sarah was leaving the office for a month rather than heading home early. She, like Jack, was a self-proclaimed workaholic. “The snow is coming down pretty heavy,” she added, “I have a feeling that if you want to head out, it will be OK.” “Well, I guess I better get back to work so I can go.” Jack stood up and wiped the remaining snow off of his clothes. As he was heading back into the office, a snowball hit him in the back of his head. He whirled around to find Amy sticking her tongue out at him. “Are you going to let her get away with that?” Sarah smiled as she began walking down the sidewalk toward the parking lot; she was leaving for the day. Jack retaliated with two snowball attacks of his own, and after fifteen minutes had passed, he decided it was time to retreat back into the warm building. Amy remained outside, choosing to freeze her toes for a while longer. Jack found himself stepping over miniature puddles of melted snow in front of his office. Mr. Jenkins had already cleaned up the mess left over from Amy’s snowball. Evidently everyone in the building was tracking in messy footprints without worrying about giving the custodian extra work. Jack rolled his eyes and unlocked his door. He stopped in his tracks. His desk was completely clean. Not a single paper remained. Walking inside, he stepped on something. Jack looked down and picked up a bent company ID card. The printed name on the card read: Alex Rebmevon. Alex, the official owner of the ID, was a fellow reporter at The Printed Voice. He was also the boss’s son. Back during his college days, Jack had once locked himself outside of his dorm room and used his student ID to pick the lock. Jack questioned if the door in his office was just as easy to get into. As Jack stood in the middle of the room, puzzled and angry by the intrusion, he heard a long whistle from behind. He turned to find Amy once again standing in the doorway. She nodded her head toward the immaculate desk. “Looks like you decided to get rid of that busy work, after all.” “I didn’t do this,” Jack held up the ID, “he did.” Amy snatched the card from his hand and studied it. “Well, it looks like this is what the culprit used alright. This card is wrecked.” “ … Only one way to find out,” Jack said, as he whipped out his cell phone and dialed Alex’s number. There was no answer. Amy was still standing in front of him. “Do you know who did it?” she asked. He thought back to Sarah and the massive shoulder bag she had been carrying. “Maybe,” he answered. But his eyes narrowed as he weighed in the evidence and ran through a growing list of suspects. Mr. Jenkins had a key to every office in the building. And he had walked back inside shortly before Jack, explaining the puddles at the door. They searched the building for the custodian and found him in the reception area, collecting trash. Jack explained the situation to him and asked about the missing papers. “You really think I would do that?” Mr. Jenkins said, hurt by the accusation. He continued, “Though, I’ll admit, I did use Alex’s ID card to break into the office. Jack replied quickly, “No, I don’t think you’re a suspect at all. You’ve been too busy cleaning all day. But, now that you mention it … why did you use the ID to break into my office?” “Well, I swear I didn’t touch anything on your desk, it was already clean as a whistle when I went in to collect your trash. I used my key to get in the first time, but I accidentally left my keys on your filing cabinet and had shut the locked door before I realized it. I found the ID on the floor earlier and it was already bent up. I figured it couldn’t be used anymore, so what was the harm in using it to get back in?” “So someone used the ID to break into my office before you found it then?” He thought about some of the things that had been taken and remembered his notes from the interview. Even the notes themselves would be something any other reporter at The Printed Voice would love to get his hands on. And one of them had. All of his co-workers were likely suspects. Who took the papers?",

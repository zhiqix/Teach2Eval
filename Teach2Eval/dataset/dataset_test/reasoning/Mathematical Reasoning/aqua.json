The question basically asks to equalise their payment. so a total of 2100 rs is received by them and they do 21 hrs work together. average rate will be 2100/21 = 100 rs per hr. so linda should get 11*100 =1100 rs.

This is very straight forward since 50 is int he middle of 20 and 80 so we need both solutions in equal quantities. If this doesn't strike, use\nw1/w2 = (A2 - Aavg)/(Aavg - A1)\nw1/w2 = (70 - 50)/(50 - 20) = 2/3\nSo the volume of the two solutions will be equal. Answer has to be 2:3\nC"

(Note: the 6 months are “1/2” in the equation since 5% s a yearly rate, not a bi-yearly one).\nSince the interest is compounded, the second six months of the year are not earning interest on just the original $6,000, but on the interest as well, so they are actually earning interest on $6,150. The interest earned during the final 6 months of the year is $6,150(.05)(1/2) = $153.75.

We are told that two out of every 30 defective chips have a defective processor. Let x be the total number of defective processors in the batch. Because we know 2 out of every 30 defective chips will have defective processors, and the total number of defective processors in the batch is 30, we can write out an equation: (2/30)x = 30. This can be simplified to (1/15)x = 30. Multiplying each side by 15, we arrive at x = 450. This tells us that there are 450 defective chips in the whole batch. Because we know that 1 out of every 1000 chips is defective, we can set up a proportion. If 1 out of every 3000 chips is defective, then 450 out of y chips would be defective, where y is the total number of chips in the batch. This can be set up as an equation as follows: 1/3000 = 450/y. Solve for y and you will get the total number of chips in the batch: 1350,000.\nThe answer is (D)."

Now if we check for option B, 30 can be written as 2*3*5, hence 30^ 2 will have 2 as the maximum power of 2, so we can leave out this option too.\nOption C is the right answer if we follow the same method as we followed for other two previous options.\n60 = (2^2)*3*5; 60^2 = (2^4)*(3^2)*(5^2).

It would take Karen t=d/r t=75/15 = 5 hours to reach john. If John had not stopped, their combined rate would 10+15 = 25 miles/hour meaning they would have met in 4 hours.

Using the permutation formula, there are 6!/(3!)(3!) = 20 ways for Team 1 to win 3 games and lose 3 games in the first 6 games.\nLogically, there are also 20 ways for Team 2 to win 3 games and lose 3 games in the first 6 games.\nThus, there are a total of 40 ways for the World Series to last the full 7 games.\nThe probability that any one of these 40 ways occurs can be calculated from the fact that the probability of a team winning a game equals the probability of a team losing a game = 1/2.\nGiven that 7 distinct events must happen in any 7 game series, and that each of these events has a probability of 1/2, the probability that any one particular 7 game series occurs is.\nSince there are 40 possible different 7 game series, the probability that the World Series will last exactly 7 games is:\nThus the probability that the World Series will last less than 7 games is 100% - 31.25% = 68.75%.\nThe correct answer is D."

(1)\nStatement 2 of the question: If Jose worked alone and completed half the work and then Jane takes over and completes the second half, the task will be completed in 45 days.\nJose will complete half the task in x/2 days.\nJane will complete half the task in y/2 days.\n∴ x/2 + y/2= 45\nOr, x + y = 90 or x = 90 - y .... (2)\nStep 2: Solve the two equations and find x and y\nSubstitute the value of x as (90 - y) in the first equation\n1/90−y + 1/y = 1/20\nOr y2 - 90 + 1800 = 0.\nThe quadratic equation factorizes as (y - 60)(y - 30) = 0\nSo, y = 60 or y = 30.\nIf y = 60, then x = 90 - y = 90 - 60 = 30 and\nIf y = 30, then x = 90 - y = 90 - 30 = 60.\nThe question clearly states that Jane is more efficient than Jose. Therefore, Jane will take lesser time than Jose.\nHence, Jose will take 60 days to complete the task if he worked alone and Jane will take 30 days to complete the same task.\nChoice C"

This tells us that 3,150 itself is not a perfect square.)\nWe also are given that 3,150 multiplied by s is the square of an integer. We can write this as:\n2^1 x 3^2 x 5^2 x 7^1 x s = square of an integer\nAccording to our rule, we need all unique prime factors' exponents to be even numbers. Thus, we need one more 2 and one more 7. Therefore, s = 7 x 2 = 14\nAnswer is E."

Similarly, the numbers in the â€œtotalsâ€ column must add up. If 40 are managers, then the other 215 â€“ 40 = 175 must be associates.\nNow, in the â€œassociateâ€ row, 135 + E = 175, which means E = 40â€” the other 40 associates must be female.\nNow, to find B, which is what the question is asking, we need only look at the sum in the â€œfemaleâ€ column: B + 40 = 90, which means B = 50. There are fifteen female managers in this company. Thus, the answer = 50(A)."

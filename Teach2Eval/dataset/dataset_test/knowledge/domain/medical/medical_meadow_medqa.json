        "question": "A 37-year-old man presents to a clinic with complaints of breathlessness and fever for the past few days. He says that the breathlessness is the same throughout the day and is not related to exertion. He recorded his body temperature at home as 38.1°C (100.5°F). Past medical history is insignificant. He denies visiting any sick person recently. He admits that he uses marijuana frequently and illicit intravenous drugs intermittently. His vital signs include: blood pressure 120/60 mm Hg, temperature 38.3°C (101.0°F), respiratory rate 16/min, and pulse rate 65/min (regular). Physical examination reveals track marks on the arms and a lesion on the patient’s left ring finger as shown in the picture below. On cardiac auscultation, an early diastolic murmur over the right second intercostal space is heard; S3 and S4 are also present. Echocardiography shows vegetation on the aortic valve and mild valve insufficiency. Serial blood cultures are performed, and results are pending. Which of the following causative agents is most likely responsible for this patient’s condition??",

Additionally, over the ensuing 8 years since his initial presentation, the patient also developed symptoms including worsening balance, orthostatic hypotension, urinary incontinence, and impotence. The patient's overall condition deteriorated ever since this initial diagnosis with increasing disability from his motor symptoms, and he recently passed away at the age of 67, 8 years after his first presentation to his physician.

The patient has a past medical history of surgical repair of his Achilles tendon, ACL, and medial meniscus. He is currently not taking any medications. The patient lives with his wife and they both practice a vegan lifestyle. On physical exam the patient states that he is currently not experiencing any pain in his foot but rather is experiencing numbness/tingling along the plantar surface of his foot. Strength is 5/5 and reflexes are 2+ in the lower extremities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis??",

The contractions occur every 10–15 minutes and have been increasing in intensity and duration since onset. Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 140/85 mm Hg. Uterine contractions are felt on palpation. Pelvic examination shows clear fluid in the vagina. The cervix is 50% effaced and 3 cm dilated. After 4 hours the cervix is 80% effaced and 6 cm dilated. Pelvic examination is inconclusive for the position of the fetal head. The fetal heart rate is reassuring. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step??",

A teacher, no matter how much he knows, he can not teach his students everything they want to know. The teacher's job is to show his students how to learn. He teaches them how to read and how to think. So much more is to be learned outside school by the students themselves.\nIt is always more important to know how to study by oneself than to learn some facts or a formula by heart. It is actually quite easy to learn a certain fact in history or a formula  in mathematics. But it is very difficult to use a formula in working out a maths problem. Great scientist, such as Einstein, Newton and Galileo, didn't get everything from school. But they were all so successful and invented so many things for men. They worked hard all their lives, wasting not a single moment. They would ask many questions as they read and they did thousands of experiments.",

But the words, Carl Walter spoke that day, came back to me\nyears later, and ever since have been of great value to me.\nCarl Walter was my piano teacher. During one of my lessons he asked how much practicing I\nwas doing. I said three or four hours a day.\n\"Do you practice\n, an hour at a time?\"\n\"I try to.\"\n\"Well, don't,\" he exclaimed. \"When you grow up, time won't come in long stretches.    Practice in minutes, whenever you can find them five or ten before school, after lunch, between household tasks. Spread the practice through the day, and piano-playing will become a part of your life.\"\nWhen I was teaching at Columbia, I wanted to write, but class periods, theme-reading, and committee meetings filled my days and evenings. For two years I got practically nothing down on paper, and my excuse was that I had no time. Then I remembered what Carl Walter had said. During the next week I conducted an experiment. Whenever I had five minutes unoccupied, I sat down and wrote a hundred words or so. To my astonishment, at the end of the week I had a rather large manuscript ready for revision, later on I wrote novels by the same piecemeal method. Though my teaching schedule had become heavier than ever, in every day there were idle moments which could be caught and put to use. I even took up piano--playing again, finding that the small intervals of the day provided sufficient time for both writing and piano practice.\nThere is an important trick in this time--using formula: you must get into your work quickly. If you have but five minutes for writing, you can't afford to waste four chewing your pencil. You must make your mental preparations beforehand, and concentrate on your task almost instantly when the time comes. Fortunately, rapid concentration is easier than most of us realize.\nI admit I have never learnt how to let go easily at the end of the five or ten minutes. But life can be counted on to supply interruptions. Carl Walter has had a tremendous influence on my life. To him I owe the discovery that even very short periods of time add up to all useful hours I need, if I plunge in without delay.",

A taxi driver needs to have not only good driving skills but also a good knowledge of the city of London, from the loneliest street to the popular restaurant around.

He said, \"I never drink when I'm working, otherwise I'd lose my license  .\"\nHe normally goes home between two and three o'clock in the morning. There are times he has to stay longer and try to make more runs. He said, \"That's the worst thing about working for yourself. If you don't make money, no one is going to give it to you. \"\nLondon taxi drivers not only \"take\" but also \"give\".

Finally, I talked Mom into asking permission for us to walk through the farm, and Mr. Blickez agreed.\nOn our way across the farm, we stopped at the fence to admire the swimming hole. The sun shone brightly across the cool waters. We couldn't wait to get there. Suddenly, Walt shouted loudly. Elsie had run to him and was licking   his back. I immediately hid under the fence. However, when I looked up, I saw that Elsie wasn't a big mean bull at all. She was just a friendly young cow, and she was going to keep licking my brother's back as long as he stood still.\nWhen we discovered the truth, we were so happy. We then ran to the swimming hole and jumped in. The water was just as wonderful as we had dreamed.

In fact,although the total pedestrian casualty  rate has fallen over the last ten years,there has been an increase in accidents caused when pedestrians have to step out into the mad to avoid parked cars on the pavement and cannot see oncoming traffic.\n    I cannot share Mr.Hogg's view that the government have paid little attention to\"long-suffering motorists\":and I think the punishment for dangerous parking should be made severe enough to stop all motorists from breaking the law in this way.\nA WALKER,\nProudfoot Lane,Carchester",

Howver, in the last ten years, when many different kinds of music have established themselves on the pop scene, more and more stars have come from other countries.\nPop music changes all the time and new stars appear and become famous. For a musician to stay popular and still produced good, original music over a long period of time, is a sign of true star.\nMost stars start their careers in a simple way---- playing in unknown night clubs or dance-hall where people want to dance to the music, not listen to it. They may have continued doing this for many years untill they get a \"break\"---- a chance to perform in a well -known place or get a recording contract. To become a star is the aim of every singer or musician and the dream of many a pop-crazy teenager.\nHowever a group or star makes it to the top, they can be sure that their lives will change once they are successful. Ordinary teenagers living at home with their parents may suddenly find themselves rich enough to buy their own houses. An established superstar may be able to buy several.\nDespite the large amount of money that are earned, life at the top is not easy for many stars.. The pop scene is hard work and many stars need to spend a lot of time away from home. For a lot of them, this means they have no home life and their personal relationships suffer.

Memorizing phone numbers\nIt was annoying to remember numbers. Now we simply add them to our contacts list. That usually works well unless our device is lost,stolen,or damaged. No one can be expected to remember all their contact numbers. What we can do is memorize 5 of our most important contact numbers. This should include a mixture of family,friends and business. If you're really ambitious you can memorize 5 contacts for each category.\n2. Map-reading skills\nThe convenience and effectiveness of GPS guidance systems and digital maps generated by search engines is unquestionable. They've definitely made our lives easier. What we don't get from using these devices and applications is the increased ability to understand spatial orientation and navigation.\nTo renew or acquire those skills,try using physical maps to plan your next trip. After a few trips,you'll be pleasantly surprised with how useful a physical map can be.\n3. Photography\nEven amateur photography requires a basic learning about lighting,depth,and composition. This is true for digital photography. Most smart cameras automatically make these adjustments. We no longer have to learn the art of photography. On most devices,this is easily changed by turning off the automatic settings. Experiment with setting by hand the scene modes,lighting,and zoom. You just may learn that you're a \"true photographer\".\n4. Reading comprehension\nThe primary cause is E-reader. They're convenient and can store thousands of books. But there's evidence that E-reader makes it more difficult for readers to keep and recall information they just read. Don't worry! What we should do is make an effort to read printed books. This will be especially helpful when seeking information we need for academic or career purposes.\n5.Hand-written correspondence \nWriting letters and notes include hand writing skills,organizational skills,and learning about the person or persons you correspond with.

This was expressed by the equation E = mc2. But bombs were not what Einstein had in mind when he published this equation.\nIn 1929, he publicly declared that if a war broke out he would \"refuse to do war service, direct or indirect....\" His position would change in 1933, as the result of Adolf Hitler's coming into power in Germany.\nEinstein's greatest role in the invention of the atomic bomb was signing a letter to President Franklin Roosevelt urging that the bomb be built because some physicists feared that Germany might be working on an atomic bomb. Among those concerned were physicists Leo Szilard and Eugene Wigner. But they had no influence with those in power. So in July 1939 they explained the problem to someone who did: Albert Einstein. After talking with Einstein, in August 1939 Szilard wrote a letter to President Roosevelt with Einstein's signature on it, which was delivered to Roosevelt in October 1939.\nGermany had invaded Poland the previous month, the time was ripe for action. That October research of a-bomb began but proceeded slowly because the invention of the atomic bomb seemed distant and unlikely. In April 1940 an Einstein letter, ghost-written by Szilard, pressed the researchers on the need for \"greater speed\".\nAs the realization of nuclear weapons grew near, Einstein looked beyond the current war to future problems that such weapons could bring. He wrote to his friend about his fear about the future use of the a-bomb.\nThe atomic bombings of Japan occurred three months after Germany gave in. \nIn November 1954, five months before his death, Einstein summarized his feelings about his role in the creation of the atomic bomb: \"I made one great mistake in my life...when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification---the danger that the Germans would make them?",

        "passage": "Train-spotting\nMany people around the world have seen Danny Boyle's movie Train spotting starring Ewan McGregor, but how many of us really know what train-spotting is all about? Now this is not considered cool in town and the word \"train-spotter\" in Britain is related to \"geek\" or \"nerd\" (someone who seems very ridiculous). But is this reputation really deserved?\nFirst of all, let's see what train-spotting is. It is said that there are some 100,000 train spotters in the UK. Exactly as the title suggests, they spot trains, that is, they stand in train stations, look at the number of each train that leaves and arrives and write it down. The eventual aim is to have seen every train in the country.\nBeing crazy about railways and trains is not modern and it dates back to 1804. As the number of trains grew and they got faster and faster, so did the interest in them grow? Is this any stranger than people who love cars?\nSo, what do you need to be a train-spotter? Well, all you really need is a pen or pencil and a notebook to write down the train numbers. Other equipment  includes hot tea in a thermos, a camera and some sandwiches for those long afternoons spent on train platforms when you don't want to risk the delights of railway station food.\nIt's interesting to note that despite the \"bad name\" of train-spotting, there have been famous railway lovers in history, such as Alfred Hitchcock, who filmed them regularly, especially The 39 Steps. There is evidence, too, that being a train-spotter is not necessarily a strange phenomenon in Britain.\nOne glance at the US train stations should be enough to convince you that train-spotters there are alive and well. In America, they try to call rail lovers \"train-fans\" and talk of \"train-fanning\". Don't let this fool you--these people are train spotters and there are a lot of them.

Creativity isn't always connected with great works of art or ideas. People at work and in their free time routinely think of creative ways to solve problems. Maybe you have a goal to achieve,a tricky question to answer or you just want to expand your mind! Here are three techniques to help you.\nThis technique involves taking unrelated ideas and trying to find links between them. First,think about the problem you have to solve or the job you need to do. Then find an image,word,idea or object,for example,a candle. Write down all the ideas/words associated with candles:light,fire,matches, wax,night,silence,etc. Think of as many as you can. The next stage is to relate the ideas to the job you have to do. So imagine you want to buy a friend an original present; you could buy him tickets to a match or take him out for the night.\nImagine that normal limitations don't exist. You have as much time/space/money,etc. as you want. Think about your goal and the new possibilities. If,for example,your goal is to learn to ski, you can now practice skiing every day of your life (because you have the time and the money). Now adapt this to reality. Maybe you can practice skiing every day in December,or every Monday in January.\nLook at the situation from a different point of view. Good negotiators use this technique in business,and so do writers. Fiction writers often imagine they are the characters in their books. They ask questions: what does this character want? Why can't she get it? What changes must she make to get what she wants? What does she dream about? If your goal involves other people, put yourself \"in their shoes\".

Therefore, they spend all day studying without time to relax.\nHowever, not all students can go to top universities even if they work very hard. Students are pressurized by parents and teachers who are just concerned about their studies and exam scores while ignoring their hobbies and individual differences. As a result, students are forces to work harder and harder. Furthermore, there is pressure coming from students themselves. They realize they have a slim chance of getting into a top university as competition is fierce. So, they put a lot of stress on themselves and stay in a nervous state day after day. If they keep it up,   they'll suffer illnesses; both psychological and physical.\nWhat students need is relaxation. This doesn't mean that they should give up their ambitions and stop studying hard.

I was living in Farley. It's about thirty miles away. I came back to London two months ago.\" I also wondered if it was the custom for boys to fight strangers like me, but I was tall for my age. I hoped they would decide not to risk it.\nNo one took any notice of me before school. I stood in the center of the playground, expecting someone to say \"hello\", but no one spoke to me. When a teacher called my name and told me where my classroom was, one or two boys looked at me but that was all.\nMy teacher was called Mr. Jones. There were 42 boys in the class, so _ , either, until the first lesson of the afternoon. Mr. Jones was very fond of Charles Dickens and he had decided to read aloud to us from David Copperfield, but first he asked several boys if they knew Dickens' birthplace, but no one guessed right. A boy called Brian, the biggest in the class, said: \"Timbuktu\", and Mr. Jones went red in the face. Then he asked me. I said: \"Portsmouth\", and everyone stared at me because Mr. Jones said I was right. This didn't make me very popular, of course.\n\"He thinks he's clever,\" I heard Brian say.\nAfter that, we went out to the playground to play football. I was in Brian's team, and he obviously had Dickens in mind because he told me to go in goal. No one ever wanted to be the goalkeeper.\n\"He's big enough and useless enough.\" Brian said when someone asked him why he had chosen me.\nI suppose Mr. Jones, who served as the judge, remembered Dickens, too, because when the game was nearly over, Brian pushed one of the players on the other team, and he gave them a penalty  . As the boy kicked the ball to my right, I threw myself down instinctively   and saved it. All my team crowded round me. My bare knees were injured and bleeding. Brian took out a handkerchief and offered it to me.\n\"Do you want to join my gang  ?\" he said.\nAt the end of the day, I was no longer a stranger.",

A part-time job can teach teenagers important skills like responsibility , independence ,teamwork and leadership.\nYoung people can expand  their social circles beyond their classmates by making friends with co-workers. And many teenagers find that earning their own money gives them a sense of pride and freedom.\nThe US Department of Labor allows teenagers to apply for jobs at the age of 14. Popular part-time jobs include working in ice cream stores, coffee shops, and clothing stores. During the school year, teenagers may go to work a few times a week after their classes get out, then work for longer on the weekends.\nIn the summer, top jobs for teens include working at camps, swimming pools and amusement parks. These jobs are great for young people who want to be active and have fun while making money.\nA favorite job for many teens is babysitting , and they can start before 14 if the parents agree. After the children are sleeping and before the parents come home, babysitters have lots of freedom.\nAs long as they stay in the house and make sure the kids are okay, babysitters can do their homework, enjoy a snack, watch TV, or talk on the phone with friends.\nIt can be stressful to balance school, homework, and a part-time job.

I feel there are a number of reasons for this.\nSome people blame the fact that we are surrounded by shops selling unhealthy, fatty foods, such as fried chicken and ice cream, at low prices. This has turned out a whole generation of grown-ups who seldom cook a meal for themselves. If there were fewer of these restaurants, then probably children would buy less take-away food.\nThere is another argument that blames parents for allowing their children to become overweight. I agree with this, because good eating habits begin early in life, long before children start to visit fast food shops. If children are given fried chicken and chocolate rather than healthy food, or are always allowed to choose what they eat, they will go for sweet and salty foods every time, and this will carry on throughout their lives.\nThere is a third reason for this situation. Children these days take very little exercise. They do not walk to school. When they get home, they sit in front of the television or their computers and play computer games. Not only is this an unhealthy pastime , it also gives them time to eat more unhealthy food.What they need is to go outside and play active games or sports.\nThe above are the main reasons for this problem, and therefore we have to encourage young people to be more active, as well as _ them away from fast food shops and bad eating habits.",

The 15-year-old girl is not good at doing sit-ups  , which is necessary for the coming high school PE entrance exam. One has to do at least 35 sit-ups in a minute to pass the test. Most of Chen's classmates can do 40. However, Chen could only do 20.\nFeeling worried, Chen decided to do something. She did sit-ups for half an hour every day after school. Now, after a month, she can do 30 sit-ups a minute.\n\"I finally found what made me slow through continuous practice and then improved little by little,\" said Chen. \"I believe next month I will be able to do 40!\"",

As you learn more and more, it feels like you know less and less because when you learn something new, you find that there is a lot to know about those things.\nSometimes, people will get stuck in this needing to gather more and more information. There's nothing wrong with learning a lot, but when you let learning get in the way of doing, you will never get going. When you never get going, you still never start having the things you want. Too much learning can paralyze you in terms of taking action.\nA better way to go about achieving a goal is to gather some information and immediately start taking action on the information you have gathered. Many times you will feel unprepared, and that's OK. The best way to learn is to take action and learn from the results you get from those actions.\nWhen you are able to get past the fear of not being perfect and just take the first step, you will be further ahead than the majority of people who are still in the preparation stage. It's good to be prepared especially in situations such as a pilot and crew making sure the plane is ready to take off, but over-preparation in trying to reach a goal won't give you any results. The knowledge and skills you will need will be picked up along the way.\nIf a baby wants to learn how to walk, it will never be able to do it by sitting there and analyzing how to walk. The best way for a baby to walk is to actually stand up and start walking. Sure it may fall, but with every fall, it will learn what is working and what is not and adjust to _ . By doing this over and over again, it will eventually learn to walk. This is the approach you need to take when you want to achieve your goals as well. It works.

When she and her twin sister, Miriam, arrived in the Auschwitz death camp, they were met by Josef Mengele and became part of the cruel scientist's experiments. Groning was a junior squad leader at the camp.\nWhile Groning could argue he was not directly responsible for procedures carried out on twins,nor for the mass murder of so many others, he played a critical role in the effort to kill Jews.\nAfter the war Groning led an ordinary, quiet life until he became alarmed by the rise of Holocaust deniers. He went public with his role and in September 2014 was charged as an accessory  to murder.\nWhen Groning went on trial in April 2015, Eva Mozes Kor was called as a witness. After her session, she walked straight up to the 93-year-old former Nazi and shook his hand.\nEva Mozes Kor will never forget nor excuse what the Nazis did. Her two books make that clear: Surviving the Angel of Death. and the earlier Echoes from Auschwitz. She has also spent her post-war years drawing attention to the Holocaust, in the hope of preventing a repeat of its horrors.\nAt the same time,  she is dedicated ( ) to healing rather than revenge.

Forgiveness is about self-healing, self-liberation, and self-empowerment...

I would be a different person if my mom hadn't turned a silly bicycle accessory into a life lesson I carry with me today.\nMy mother and father were united in their way of raising children, but it mostly fell to my mother to actually carry it out. Looking back, I honestly don't know how she did it. Managing the family budget must have been a very hard task., but she made it look effortless. If we complained about not having what another kid did, we'd hear something like, \"I don't care what so -and -so got for his birthday, you are not getting a TV in your room a car for your birthday a lsvish sweet 16 party.\" We had to earn our allowance by doing chores around the house. I can stil l remember how long it took to polish the legs of our coffee table.My brothers can no doubt remember hours spent cleaning the house .Like the two little girls growing up at the White House,we made our own beds (no one left the house unitil that was done)and picked up after ourselves.We had to keep track of our belongings ,and if something was lost ,it was not replaced.\nIt was summer and ,one day ,my mother drove me to the bike shop to get a tire fixed---and there it was in the window, White, shiny, plastic and decorated with flowers ,the basket winked at me and I knew ----I knew---I had to have it.\n\"It's beautiful,\" my mother said when I pointed it out to her,\"What a neat basket.\"\nI tried to hold off at first ,I played it cool for a short while. But then I guess I couldn't at and it any longer:\"Mom, please can I please ,please get it? I 'll do extra chores for as long as you say, I'll do anything ,but I need that basket,I love that basket.Please ,Mom .Please?\"\nI was desperate.\n\"You know,\" she said ,gently rubbing my back while we both stared at what I believes was the coolest thing ever,\" If you save up you could buy this yourself.\"\n\"By the time I make enough it'll bu gone!\"\n\"Maybe Roger here could hold it for you,\" she smiled at Roger ,the bike guy.\n\"He can't hold it for that long ,Mom .Someone else will buy it .Please, Mom,Please?\"\n\"There might be another way,\" she said.\nAnd so our paying plan unfolded. My mother bought the beautiful basket and put it safely in some hiding place I couldn't find. Each week I eagerly counted my growing saving increased by extra work here and there (washing the car ,helping my mother make dinner, delivering or collecting things on my bike that already looked _ without the basket in front).And then ,weeks later ,I counted ,re-counted and jumped for joy. Oh ,happy day ! I made it! I finally had the exact amount we'd agreed upon....\nDays later the unthinkable happened. A neighborhood girl I'd played with millions of times appeared with the exact same basket fixed to her shiny ,new bike that already had all the bells and whistles. I rode hard and fast home to tell my mother about this disaster. This horrible turn of events.\nAnd then came the lesson . I've taken with me through my life:\"Honey, Your basket is extra-special,\" Mom said, gently wiping away my hot tears.\"Your basket is special because you paid for it yourself.\"",

A lighted cigarette thrown out of a car or train window or a broken bottle lying on dry grass can start a fire. Sometimes, though, a fire can start on its own. Wet hay   can begin burning by itself. This is how it happens: the hay starts to rot   and begins to give off heat which is trapped inside it. Finally, it bursts into flames. That's why farmers cut and store   their hay when it's dry.\nFires have destroyed whole cities. In the 17th century, a small fire which began in a baker's shop burnt down nearly every building in London. Moscow was set on fire during the war against Napoleon. This fire continued burning for seven days. And, of course, in 64 A.D. a fire burnt Rome. Even today, in spite of modern fire-fighting methods, fire causes millions of pounds' worthy of damage each year both in our cities and in the countryside.

Researchers from Australia say that the presence of the particles  in an eucalyptus tree's leaves indicates that deposits  are buried many meters below. They believe that the discovery offers a new way to locate the valuable metal in difficult-to-reach locations.\n              Dr. Mel Lintern from Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) said, \"We've found a lot of the easy deposits in Australia in this way. Now we are trying to find the more difficult ones that are buried tens of meters below. And the trees are providing us with a method to be able to do this.\"\n              Using the Australian synchrotron - a vast machine that uses X-rays to explore matter in remarkable detail - they found gold in the leaves, twigs and bark of some trees. The amount of the precious metal in an eucalyptus tree's leaves were tiny. \"We need 500 eucalyptus trees growing over a gold deposit to have enough gold in the trees themselves to make a gold ring,\" said Dr. Lintern. However, the presence of the particles pointed to richer deposits buried more than 30m below.\n              Dr. Lintern said, \"We believe that the trees are acting like a pump. They are bringing life-giving water from their roots, and in so doing, they are taking smaller dissolved gold particles up into the leaves.\"\n              Currently, the metal is found in outcrops ,where the ore  appears at the surface, or it is detected through exploratory drilling.\n              But the researchers said that analyzing plants could offer a better and simpler method to detect untapped gold deposits. Dr. Lintern said, \"Not only do we believe it is a way of saving the exploration cost, because exploring for these deposits can be quite expensive, it also minimizes the damage to the environment because we are taking a very small sample from the trees themselves, as well as the leaves and twigs on the ground. The plant-analyzing method is certain to work.\"",

Yesterday he proudly claimed in court that despite his complete lack of medical experience or qualifications, he had saved several people's lives. He had even been allowed to assist a surgeon during an emergency operation on a patient who was about to die on something she had swallowed.\n\"I watched one of those TV dramas about a hospital and suddenly I felt like playing one of the roles myself. So I put on a white jacket and a stethoscope and walked around one of the biggest hospital in London. At first I just watched. Once you learn how doctors talk to patients, nurses and others doctors, it's easy to take people in,\" he said.\nOne of the patients he treated was Laura Kennan. She had been knocked down by a car and fainted. When she came to in hospital, York was standing over her.\n\"He looked very professional. He told me his name was Doctor Simon. Then he gave me some sort of injection,\" she said. And then he suddenly cleared off when a nurse asked who he was. She didn't think there was anything wrong. \"I would never have realized he was a fake if a policewoman hadn't showed me his photograph a week later. When the policewoman told me who he really was, I could hardly believe my ears.\"\nJudge Raymond Adams told York that he was \" shocked and horrified\" that he got away with his deceiving for so long. And they sentenced him to eighteen months in a special prison for criminal with mental disorders.\n\"I can only hope that this will not lead to further problems. After all, you will have considerable opportunity to study the behaviour of the psychiatrists who will look after you while you are there. If you try to persuade people that you yourself are a psychiatrist after you are set free, I shall make sure that you are given a much longer sentence.\" Judge Adams warned York.",

People visiting the exhibition said they had waited as long as one and a half hours to get in. Ravi Nair, a 73-year-old Indian visitor, said: \"I had to queue for about an hour but it was worth it. The exhibition should help people in democratic countries realize that their vote is very valuable.\"\nTrabold said \"Hitler and the Germans\" was so popular because it was the first exhibition to explain how a man who lived on the margins of society for 30 years, in Vienna's men's hostels, could become an almost mythical leader of the German people. \"We are all affected by Hitler, so it speaks to all of us and helps Germans and foreigners to come to terms with the past.\" Inge Lonning, a 72-year-old tourist from Norway said: \"I thought the exhibition was very impressive. I wanted to see it because I experienced the German occupation of Norway as a small child, so it's not just history for me.\" But not everyone was convinced there was something new to be learned from the exhibition. \"So much has been done about this period over the years, it was like, I knew this and I knew that,\" said Canadian Julien Cayer, aged 28. \"I thought I'd find something new but I didn't.\"\nThere has been widespread concern in the German media that the exhibition could become a magnet for neo-Nazi admirers of Hitler, but Trabold said that although there had been some right-wing extremist visitors, they had not caused any problems.",

Adams and his family moved to the White House in 1800, when the decoration of the building was not finished. And it was not until during Thomas Jefferson's term (1801-1809) that the decoration was finally completed.\nPresident John Tyler (1841-1845) was the first president to have his photo taken.

        "passage": "Thousands of people living in the Chinese capital will celebrate the start of the Chinese New year by heading for the ski resorts  . Never mind that Beijing's dry weather seldom produces snow. It is cold enough in winter for snow-making machines to make a covering for the hills north to the capital. And the rapid growth of a pleasure-seeking middle class has formed the basis for this new craze .\nSince Beijing's first ski resort was opened ten years ago, the sport has enjoyed astonishing increase. There are now more than a dozen resorts. Clothes markets in the city have added bright colored ski suits to their winter collections. Mr. Wei, a manager of a newly-opened ski resort in  Beijing, sees the growth of an industry that could soon lead Chinese to head for the ski resorts of Europe. In recent years, ski resorts offering natural snow have opened in China. But many are in faraway areas of the country and can't really match the equipment and services of some ski resorts in Europe.\nBeijing's skiing craze is partly a result of the recent increase in private   cars. This has led to the growth of a _ in the capital's suburbs  , which until the late-1990s were unreachable to ordinary people. According to Mr. Wei, about 40% of the visitors to his resort come in their own cars. The rest are bused in by schools, businesses or government offices.\nThe problem is making money. Starting ski resorts requires quite a lot of money; hiring land from the local government, preparing the hills, buying snow machines, making sure there are enough water and electricity to run them, and buying ski equipment for hiring out to customers.\nThe ski resort where Mr. Wei works cost nearly $4 million to set up. And as so often in China when someone comes up with a good idea, many others rush in and price wars break out. Beijing now offers some of the cheapest ski training classes in the world, though with most people rather new to the sport, expecting a few more doing the same job.",

        "passage": "We experience different forms of the Sun's energy every day. We can see its light and feel its warmth. The Sun is the major source of energy for our planet. It causes the evaporation   of water from the oceans and lakes. Sunlight also provides the energy used by green plants to make their own food. These green plants then provide food for all organisms  on the Earth.\nMuch of the energy that comes from the Sun never reaches the Earth's surface. It is either reflected or absorbed by the gases in the upper atmosphere. Of the energy that reaches the lower atmosphere,30% is reflected by clouds or the Earth's surface. The remaining 70% warms the surface of the planet, causes water to evaporate, and provides energy for the water cycle and weather. Only a tiny part, approximately 0.023%, is actually used by green plants to produce food.\nMany gases found in the atmosphere actually reflect heat energy escaping from the Earth's surface back to the Earth. These gases act like the glass of a greenhouse in that they allow energy from the Sun to enter but prevent energy from leaving. They are therefore called greenhouse gases.\nWhen sunlight strikes an object, some of the energy is absorbed and some is reflected. The amount reflected depends on the surface. For example, you've probably noticed how bright snow is when sunlight falls on it. Snow reflects most of the energy from the Sun, so it contributes to the low temperatures of winter. Dark-coloured surfaces, such as dark soil or forest, absorb more energy and help warm the surrounding air.",

However, the parts of the body that must be covered vary widely throughout the world. Some clothing is worn to provide supernatural protection. Wearing a lucky shirt to take an exam is calling for supernatural assistance.\nPeople in all cultures use clothing and other forms of bodily decoration to communicate status , intentions and other messages. In North America, we dress differently for business and various leisure activities. North American women usually are much more knowledgeable of little difference in messages communicated by clothes than men. At times, this leads to silly mistakes of understanding of female intentions on the part of men. Of course, clothing styles also are intended to communicate messages to members of the same gender .\nLong before we are near enough to talk to someone, their appearance tells their gender, age, economic class, and often even intentions. We begin to recognize the important cultural clues at an early age. The vocabulary of dress that we learn includes not only items of clothing but also hairstyles, jewelry, and other body decoration. In most cultures, however, the same style of dress communicates different messages depending on the age, gender, and physical appearance of the individual wearing it.\nPutting on certain types of clothing can change your behavior and the behavior of others towards you. This can be the case with a doctor's white lab coat, or an army uniform. Most uniforms are clearly symbolic so that they can rapidly and unmistakably communicate status. For instance, the strange hairstyle and clothing of the English \"punks\" are essential aspects of their uniforms.\nThere are many forms of body decoration other than clothes that are used around the world to send messages. These include body and hair paint, and even body deformation. When doctors put braces on teeth, they are actually doing the same thing - deforming or reforming a part of the body to make it more attractive.",

While this may be a valid assumption in situations that don't change,it's unlikely to hold true in a changing situation.In today's rapid changing global environment,old methods often don't work,and stubbornly using them can lead to major problems.\nMost people seem to agree with conventional wisdom because it gives one a false sense of security.If everyone else believes it,then it must be true.Individuals who use conventional wisdom are certain that they are right,and being right is good. They want to continue using old ideas rather than take risks with changes that might not work.In 1977,Ken Olsen,co-founder and CEO of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC),stated \"There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.\" Despite being a dominant leader in the computer industry,DEC no longer exists.\nPeople seem to forget that since innovation is a change,there can be no innovation without change.Unfortunately,conventional wisdom prevents leaders,followers and companies from changing and therefore innovating.If companies don't innovate,but their competitors do,the future is likely to be problematic. Breaking from conventional wisdom has led to many of the most innovative companies and products in history across many industries,so it has a powerful effect on business success.\nTed Turner (founder of CNN) knew little,if anything,about the news business,but he knew it was inconvenient to watch news only at the dinner hour,as was common before CNN.Turner's solution was to create a cable channel dedicated to news 24 hours a day.The news establishment reflected conventional wisdom at the time,and predicted his idea would fail because no one wanted to watch the news all day.However,it doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand that viewers don't have to watch the news all day for the CNN to work.Viewers just have to watch when they want to get information.Due to conventional thinking,the critics failed to recognize the opportunity that was clear to Ted. They assumed that only what was familiar to them could work in the future.\nConventional wisdom prevents creativity,flexibility and risk-taking,so unconventional leaders enthusiastically break from it.To survive,thrive and maintain competitive advantage,companies must be flexible when reacting to change.",

As colleges struggle for market share, they are looking for names that project the image they want or reflect the changes they hope to make. Trenton State College, for example, became the College of New Jersey nine years ago when it began raising admission standards and appealing to students from throughout the state.\n\"All I hear in higher education is, 'Brand, brand, brand,'\" said Tim Westerbeck, who specializes in branding and is managing director of Lippmann Hearne, a marketing firm based in Chicago that works with universities and other nonprofit organizations. \"There has been a sea change over the last 10 years. Marketing used to be almost a dirty word in higher education.\"\n    Not all efforts at name changes are successful, of course. In 1997, the New School for Social Research becameprefix = st1 /NewSchoolUniversityto reflect its growth into a collection of eight colleges, offering a list of majors that includes psychology, music, urban studies and management. But New Yorkers continued to call it theNewSchool.\nNow, after spending an undisclosed sum on an online survey and a marketing consultant's creation of \"naming structures\", \"brand architecture\" and \"identity systems\", the university has  _ a new name: theNewSchool. Beginning Monday, it will adopt new logos, banners, business cards and even new names for the individual colleges, all to include the words \"theNewSchool\".\n    Changes in names generally show significant changes in how a college wants to be accepted. In changing its name from Cal State, Hayward, to Cal State, East Bay, the university hoped to project its expanding role in two mostly suburban counties east ofSan Francisco.\n    Beaver College turned itself intoArcadiaUniversityin 2001 for several reasons: to break the connection with its past as a women's college, to promote its growth into a full-fledged university and, officials acknowledged, to put an end to jokes about the college's old name on late-night television and \"morning zoo\" radio shows.\nMany college officials said changing a name and image could produce vital results. At Arcadia, in addition to the rise in applications, the average student's test score has increased by 60 points, Juli Roebeck, an Arcadiaspokeswoman, said.",

But I surprised myself.\nAt dinner the president of the university talked about the wonderful activities on campus  including guest lectures and social gatherings. He also made it perfectly clear that free food would be offered at all future events. He continued with explanations of professors, class sizes, activities, and sporting events on campus. As he spoke, I began to realize that this school, though not as good as my first choice, might be the best one for me. It seemed small yet with many great programs. It seemed challenging yet caring.\nAs the president ended his speech, we clapped politely and pushed back our chairs. As I walked out that door, a feeling of comfort washed over me.

Yet he was too proud to accept anything from the people in the village. \nOnce, these veterans held a reunion dinner in the home of Jules Grandin, who had made a good deal of money. Grandin produced a curiosity --a large old gold coin. Each man examined it with interest as it passed around the long table. All, however, had drunk wine freely and the room was full of noisy talk, so that the gold piece was soon forgotten. Later, when Grandin remembered it and asked for it, the coin was missing.\nOne of them suggested everyone be searched, to which all agreed, except Blustering. \"You refuse, then?\" asked Grandin. Blustering said with a red face, \"Yes, I cannot allow it.\"\nOne by one, the others turned out their pockets. When the coin failed to appear, attention was focused on poor Blustering. Under the pitying stares of his friends, he walked out and returned to his home.\nA few years later, Grandin made his house repaired. A workman found the gold coin, buried in dirt between planks   of the floor. Hurrying to Blustering's home, Grandin apologized to him. \n\"But why didn't you allow yourself be searched?\"\n\"Because I was a thief,\" Blustering said brokenly. \"For weeks we had not had enough to eat and my pockets were full of food that I had taken from the table to carry home to my wife and hungry children.\"",

At that time Yangzhou was a famous port and one of few biggest cities in East Asia.\nWith the improvement of the local economy and easy transportation way, there happened in the history a special local culture, which has an important place in Chinese culture.

Zheng Banqiao, a famous Chinese painting painter in the Qing Dynasty heading a group called \"Eight Eccentrics\", had strongly influenced Chinese paintings. Wang Zhong and Yuan Yuan and some other scholars formed school of Yangzhou Scholars and achieved great success in the study of classic Chinese and writing. Zhu Ziqing, one of most famous modern Chinese writers and scholars, had always been proud of himself as a native of Yangzhou and thanked the city for being nourished  by its rich culture. Quite a few other names you may come across frequently in the study of Chinese culture and history have connection with Yangzhou . Yangzhou was so attractive and important that many Chinese emperors in history had come specially to visit or check the city.

They say students who play sports for their school should receive salaries.\nTop athletes should be paid because many of them practice full time, Mark Jameson argues. Rico Cannon, a former college football player, agrees. \"Nonathletes can get a job for extra spending money, but many student athletes spend so many hours in training that they don't have time to work,\" he explains. \"Shouldn't athletes be able to earn extra money too?\"\nThe students also make money for their schools when people buy tickets to their games. The players should receive some of that cash, supporter Robbie Pokora reasons.\nCollege athletes are about honor and tradition, but they're also a business. Thanks to ticket sales, there's money for schools to build new athletic stadiums and give the coaches high salaries. The cash should be shared with athletes. They're the ones out on the field or court working hard for their school.\nThe money matter has others _ , though. Kaitlyn Rentala argues that colleges should not pay their athletes. Students are in school to get an education. Playing a sport is an extracurricular activity, not a job. If athletes need extra money, they can apply for college scholarships . Michael Massett is a middle school teacher and a football and a basketball coach. He agrees. \"Athletes should be paid with scholarships, like nonathletes are,\" Massett explains.\nIn addition, if colleges pay their athletes, those students might focus more on sports than on their education. \"Most students do not become professional athletes after college. If they focus too much on sports, they may not learn the skills they need to get good jobs,\" Kate Macrae reasons. Plus, she says, many athletes have schoolships that help them pay for school.",

For this reason you get a Doctorate  of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in biochemistry, or computer science, or psychology.\nTwo broad sub-fields of philosophy are logic and the history of philosophy. Logic is the science of argument and critical thinking. It provides sound methods for distinguishing good from bad reasoning. The history of philosophy involves the study of major philosophers and periods in the development of philosophy.\nOf what use is philosophy? First it is useful in educational advancement. It is necessary for understanding other disciplines.  Only philosophy questions the nature of the concepts used in a discipline, and its relation to other disciplines. And through the study of philosophy, one develops sound methods of research and analysis that can be applied to any field.\nThere are a number of general uses of philosophy. It strengthens one's ability to solve problems, to communicate, to organize ideas and issues, to persuade, and to take what is the most important from a large quantity of data.These general uses are of great benefit in the career field, not necessarily for obtaining one's first job after graduation, but for preparing for positions of responsibility, management and leadership later on. It is very short-sighted after all, to take a course of studies only for the purpose of getting one's first job. The useful skills developed through the study of philosophy have significant long-term benefits in career advancement. No other discipline systematically follows the ideals of wisdom, leadership, and capacity to resolve human conflict.",

        "passage": "For many American teenagers, having a part-time job is an important part of growing up. A part-time job can teach teenagers important skills like responsibility , independence ,teamwork and leadership.\nYoung people can expand  their social circles beyond their classmates by making friends with co-workers. And many teenagers find that earning their own money gives them a sense of pride and freedom.\nThe US Department of Labor allows teenagers to apply for jobs at the age of 14. Popular part-time jobs include working in ice cream stores, coffee shops, and clothing stores. During the school year, teenagers may go to work a few times a week after their classes get out, then work for longer on the weekends.\nIn the summer, top jobs for teens include working at camps, swimming pools and amusement parks. These jobs are great for young people who want to be active and have fun while making money.\nA favorite job for many teens is babysitting , and they can start before 14 if the parents agree. After the children are sleeping and before the parents come home, babysitters have lots of freedom.\nAs long as they stay in the house and make sure the kids are okay, babysitters can do their homework, enjoy a snack, watch TV, or talk on the phone with friends.\nIt can be stressful to balance school, homework, and a part-time job. Still, many American teenagers value their work experience and the skills they gain on the job.",

        "passage": "Being young is great. Most of the parts of your body still work great, you have a full head of hair, you're energetic, and you have a world of opportunity in front of you. However, there's going to come a time when you start to get older. And as you get older, you'll have new responsibilities, complete independence, and perhaps most importantly, less time to recover from mistakes.\nYou see, we all make mistakes in life. Maybe you spent more money than you should have on a car, you passed up on a great job opportunity, or you didn't try as hard as you could have in school. It's a part of life and we learn from it. But there are certain mistakes that are much better made while you're still young and have plenty of time to recover.\nI'm definitely not telling you that you should purposely go out and make these mistakes (because they're a pain to recover from). But these are all mistakes that are much better made when you're younger so that you can learn from them and not have them ruin your entire life.\nStarting the wrong career\nWouldn't you hate to be 45 years old and discover that you absolutely hate what you do for a living? It's a reality that a lot of people face and it can be difficult to fix. You see, when you're 23 and find out you don't like the career path you've chosen, you can easily explore new career options.\nWe no longer live in an age when people are expected to stay with one company until they retire. You can bounce around a little bit and find out what you want to do. When you get older, just switching careers whenever you want isn't as simple.\nYou have to consider your family, retirement, the difficulties you might run into with starting from the bottom in a new industry, and plenty of other issues that someone in their early 20's just doesn't have to deal with.\nDating the wrong person\nThe divorce rate in the U.S is extremely high. Other parts of the world aren't doing too much better either. While everyone gets divorced for their own reasons, I think we can all agree that it's better to find out that the person you're with is wrong for you sooner rather than later.\nHopefully you find out whether or not the person you're with is right for you before you tie the knot, because around 50% of first marriages end in divorce.\nMessing up your credit\nRuining your credit is never a good idea. Even if you ruin it while you're young, it could affect you in the future. The upside of having bad credit while you're young instead of older is that you have time to build it back up.\nIt can take 7-10 years to rebuild your credit if you have a history of late payments, loan defaults, foreclosures, or bankruptcy. During those 7-10 years, you'll have a hard time financing anything unless you have a cosigner or put down a substantial down payment.\nMost people tend to make most of the bigger purchases in life when they get older such as a house or their dream car. If you have bad credit, you can kiss all of that goodbye.\nMaking bad investments\nIf you're investing money for your retirement, making bad decisions can mean you'll be working your entire life. Whether you choose to pay someone to do the investing for you or handle it all yourself, it's a lot better to take risks when you're younger.\nIf you invest in stock or even real estate while you're young and the market takes a hit, you're not ruined. Investing is a long-term venture, so the younger you start, the more fluctuation you can withstand and still come out with a positive return.\nBlowing your money\nWhat would you do if you went broke at 60 years old? You would be working your behind off when you really should be relaxing and getting ready to retire soon.\nBut if you're 25 and broke, you still have plenty of time to earn more money. Also, nobody will judge you because it's not unusual for people in their 20's to not have money these days. You might have blown your money on a nice car or have an obsession with all the newest gadgets.\nWhen you get older, you'll be able to look back and realize how dumb you were for spending $20,000 on a brand new car when you were only 20 years old. But when you're older and waste your money, you'll REALLY have nothing to show for it.",

Researchers have studied each of her messages to the Commonwealth countries since 1952 to find out the change in her pronunciation from the noble Upper Received to the Standard Received.\nJonathan Harrington, a professor at Germany's University of Munich, wanted to discover whether accent changes recorded over the past half century would take place within one person. \"As far as I know, there just is nobody else for whom there is this sort of broadcast records,\" he said.\nHe said the noble way of pronouncing vowels  had gradually lost ground as the noble upper-class accent over the past years. \"Her accent sounds slightly less noble than it did 50 years ago. But these are very, very small and slow changes that we don't notice from year to year.\"\n\"We may be able to relate it to changes in the social classes,\" he told The Daily Telegraph, a British  newspaper. \"In 1952 she would have been heard saying 'thet men in the bleck het'. Now it would be 'that man in the black hat'. Similarly, she would have spoken of 'the citay' and'dutay', rather than 'citee' and 'dutee', and 'hame' rather than 'home'. In the 1950s she would have been 'lorst', but by the 1970s 'lost'.\"\nThe Queen's broadcast is a personal message to the Commonwealth countries.

        "passage": "We've all felt discouragement at one point or another in our lives. However, when this emotion bleeds into other aspects of our life, it can sometimes be inappropriate or even harmful.\nI was personally discouraged by an adult during my high school. After telling her what university I wanted to attend, she plainly told me I would not get in. I was completely shocked and angry at her statement. The adult may have not intended to hurt me with her words, but it had an after effect. The meeting made me think she had no belief that I could possibly succeed in the future. After that it caused me to try to avoid any future meeting with adults until absolutely necessary.\nWe are all human; therefore, we can all understand that some days are more challenging. But when people allow situations of stress to consume  them, they cannot perform their best. People should pay attention to how their reactions could affect the person they are interacting with. People have the potential to perform their best when they _ the task at hand, but adults who come off in a rude and aggressive way through communication have an effect on teenagers' mind.\nAdults whether in schools, or any other institutions should work to tear down walls gently and create a safe space for the person they are serving. These adults should also help and contribute to a person's academic, personal and professional growth. High school is an important time when young people need someone to believe in them.\nIn conclusion, I would like to add that it is not completely up to adults only. Students are responsible for seeking help from adults who are in authority  positions. They are also responsible for the way they approach adults in their academic surroundings. Students can expect to be treated in a respectful way when they express at the beginning. Generally the responsibility lies on both parties. When both sides can communicate in a polite manner then the complete environment of the school has the potential to develop well.",

Several sad, old men sat mute, their morale very low.\nThe camp was pitched at the edge of a deep valley--so deep that one could barely see the calm water at the bottom. The Indians had been taken by surprise and were surrounded and attacked by enemy forces. They fought bravely, but they were degraded by defeat. Their homes were destroyed. Those who had survived had been pursued by the enemy. The chase  had lasted for days. Persuaded by their leaders to press on, they had made a wrong turn. Their  _ journey ended at the edge of a valley--a desperate situation. Before them was a great hole in the earth. Behind them was the enemy. No wonder they were frozen with fear. Where could they go?\nJust when no choice seemed available to them, several young braves ran into camp. With great excitement they reported seeing a stone bridge across the valley, just a short distance from camp. Most of the tribe discounted this wild story. However, a few hurried to the spot to see for themselves. Seeing was believing! Indeed there was a stone bridge, great enough to accommodate many people and their horses. Without hesitation the people gathered up their children and the belongings they had and hurried across the bridge.\nEnemy braves watched from a nearby cliff. It was obvious that the Great Spirit was on the side of the defeated. The enemy did not follow. Safe on the other side of the valley, the wanderers thanked the Great Spirit for providing the vital link.

Not very well probably, especially if someone was pointing a gun at you. We all see a lot of violence of films, but recently some programs on television showed how people can defend themselves without guns. For example, in one film a woman was attacked from behind. She threw the man, who was heavier and stronger than she was, over her head. Then she held him tightly on the ground. How? She knew Judo.\nJiu-jitsu, as judo is sometimes called, means \"muscle science\" in Japanese. The student of judo needs to learn a lot about the body, its bones and muscles. Judo uses a number of \"falls\", \"holds\" and \"throws\". Someone who does not know judo cannot defend himself against them. If you know judo you can defend yourself against a person who is stronger than you. You had better not practice judo on your friends unless they can fall without hurting themselves! Being strong is one thing, but using the body wisely is another. In judo, you use the other person's body to help you. You \"throw\" him to the ground and \"hold\" him there, so that he cannot move. Of course, it takes time and practice, but knowing judo is useful. In a violent world you ought to be able to defend yourself.",

Temple is just one example of movie stars that China adored, and still adores. Here's our editor's pick of the top movie stars who have influenced China.\n1. Sylvester Stallone\nOh, Rambo! The first strong American man that China knew. His accented English, easily recognizable even for someone who doesn't speak English, and his eyes that never seemed to smile, makes him someone whom cannot be forgotten. He represented the strong American image, and even stirred a boxing and bodybuilding fever in China.\n2.Charlie Chaplin (April 16, 1889 - December 25, 1977)\nIn the 20th century, it is not too much to say that Einstein made the greatest contributions to science, and not many would disagree that Chaplin did the same for film. He was the first actor that introduced comedy to most Chinese viewers, and politically, he was also a close friend of China's. His silent films broke the barrier of language and his form of art was recognized by all. It will be a difficult task to find a person in China who does not recognize Chaplin, even today.\n3. Shirley Temple ( April 23, 1928 - February 10, 2014)\nWhen Chinese audiences saw this adorable child star for the first time on screen, Shirley Temple had already lived for more than half a century. In her movies, she was always alone or in trouble, but this adorable little blonde  could always resolve anything with her kindness, push away the fogginess and bring about light. The brand \"Shirley Temple\" was a product of the Great Depression. People watched her act to forget their hardships as Temple entertained the poor, the rich, adults and children alike. Several decades later, when her films were screened in China, the effects were the same.\n4. Audrey Hepburn( May 4, 1929 - January 20, 1993)\nShe will forever be the princess in Chinese people's hearts. Even to this day, a large number of tourists go to Rome to visit the Mouth of Truth with their lovers and eat ice cream on the Spanish Steps. Her sense of style seems to never go out of style. When she was alive, she was living perfection. Even after her death, she has remained an _ . That's something that only Audrey Hepburn is capable of.",

Time for kids asked for advice from Susan Beacham of Money Savvy Generation, a company that teaches money-management skills to kids.\n\" My first tip is to make a list and check it twice,\" says Beacham. She suggests that kids talk with their families about whom to include in their gift giving and how much to spend. Start by writing down names, Beacham says. Then put a dollar amount next to each name and add it up. Do you have enough money? If not, make changes. And don't forget---- not everyone needs a store-bought gift. Beacham points out that some of the best presents are free. Add to your list the names of people you want to give gifts of time and talent.\nDo the match\nTake the list with you to the store and \"make sure that you do the math,\" says Beacham \" If you've spent $ 30 on someone you were going to spent $25 on, you're going to have to spend $5 less on somebody else.\" The key to budgeting is staying within the boundaries you've set for yourself.\nGifts from the heart\nThe best gifts don't cost a thing. Here are some of Beacham's top gifts ideas.\n*For parents, make coupons  that can be trade for your services, such as doing dishes.\n*For grandma, write a note telling her how special she is to you.\n*For a friend, create a work of art, like a poem, a drawing or a necklace.\n*For teachers, bake a delicious cake.",

It seems that the stars are moving all the time.\nActually, there is nothing wrong with your eyes. This twinkling effect is called scintillation  . Scintillation happens because of air movements in the earth's atmosphere  . Light is \"bent  \" when it travels through different parts of the earth's atmosphere. As the air in the earth's atmosphere is moving all the time, the light from the stars looks as if it is moving too.\nThe same thing also happens to things on the ground. On a very hot and shiny day, if you look at the road, the image in the distance is not clear and things move slightly. You can also see the same effect if you drop a rock into water. The rock appears a little unclear under the moving water.\nThis twinkling effect causes a lot of problems for astronomers   since they cannot _ the stars clearly. A telescope   was sent into space so that the air movements in the atmosphere could be avoided  . It took a long time to build the space telescope but finally in 1990, a huge space telescope called the Hubble Space Telescope was successfully sent into space. Since then, astronomers have many important observations that have helped people understand space better.\n,.  (10)",

Researchers from Australia say that the presence of the particles  in an eucalyptus tree's leaves indicates that deposits  are buried many meters below. They believe that the discovery offers a new way to locate the valuable metal in difficult-to-reach locations.\n              Dr. Mel Lintern from Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) said, \"We've found a lot of the easy deposits in Australia in this way. Now we are trying to find the more difficult ones that are buried tens of meters below. And the trees are providing us with a method to be able to do this.\"\n              Using the Australian synchrotron - a vast machine that uses X-rays to explore matter in remarkable detail - they found gold in the leaves, twigs and bark of some trees. The amount of the precious metal in an eucalyptus tree's leaves were tiny. \"We need 500 eucalyptus trees growing over a gold deposit to have enough gold in the trees themselves to make a gold ring,\" said Dr. Lintern. However, the presence of the particles pointed to richer deposits buried more than 30m below.\n              Dr. Lintern said, \"We believe that the trees are acting like a pump. They are bringing life-giving water from their roots, and in so doing, they are taking smaller dissolved gold particles up into the leaves.\"\n              Currently, the metal is found in outcrops ,where the ore  appears at the surface, or it is detected through exploratory drilling.\n              But the researchers said that analyzing plants could offer a better and simpler method to detect untapped gold deposits. Dr. Lintern said, \"Not only do we believe it is a way of saving the exploration cost, because exploring for these deposits can be quite expensive, it also minimizes the damage to the environment because we are taking a very small sample from the trees themselves, as well as the leaves and twigs on the ground. The plant-analyzing method is certain to work.\"",

When I first took skiing lessons , I found it exciting. For ski racing,there's no question I'm better shape than most guys . I think it's fun. I mean,it is a challenge . It's where I picked up the idea of needing a challenge always in my life. In order to improve my skiing skills,I have read many books and magazines about it. No doubt it's my dream to win gold medals in the Olympic Games.\nAn Oi 15 years old China\nI'm different because I prefer to drop out of the world to create my own world. I'd like to build a house on a mountain. And I choose to live without electricity, a telephone,or even indoor plumbing .

        "passage": "The college entrance exam is not only a big challenge   for Chinese high school students, but also a very important exam in the lives of South Korean students.\nAlthough the long, cold winter has already started in South Korea, the annual   national exams have made the atmosphere very heated.\nMore than 675,000 South Korean high school graduates took the college entrance exam last Wednesday. They usually take exams in Korean, maths, sociology  , history and foreign languages.\nOfficially there is one college place for every 1.33 students. But because all the students want to go to the top universities in the country, the competition can reach one place for 10 students. The students want to attend these colleges for both their famous names and better job opportunities.\nBecause students face fierce competition, they have to study very hard to realize their dreams. Park Seung said he and his classmates often go to school before 7:30 a.m. After school has finished at 6:30 p.m., most of them go to the library to continue their study instead of returning home. Since many libraries in South Korea are open 24 hours a day, they often stay long into the night. Many of the Senior 3 students only sleep for three to four hours a day. \"I feel a lot of pressure, but I have to study very hard in order to make my dream come true. This is my lifetime goal and it will be a turning point in my life which could decide my future,\" Park said.\nThe exam day is a very serious day for the whole of South Korea. Vehicles are not allowed within a 200-metre radius   of all the test sites to make sure the students have quiet surroundings. Tooting   of horns is forbidden, even airplanes are ordered to avoid landing and take-off near the test sites during listening comprehension test hours.\nStudents are told their scores in December before they apply for college. This is followed by face-to-face oral tests. There are public and private universities in South Korea. Many private universities are well-known, but their fees can be 18, 000 yuan each term. This has made a lot of students think again.",

This is creating problems for polar bears that make their homes off northern Alaska and in Hudson Bay.\nPolar bears off Alaska normally hunt and raise their young on ice sheets that float on the ocean. But as the ice has melted, the polar bears have been forced to spend more time on land. There, they have begun to frequent beaches, feeding on the remains of whales caught by native hunters. For polar bears, this food is less nutritious than seals that they normally catch on ice sheets. The shrinking  ice has also forced more polar bears into the ocean. In the past, they only had to swim short distances between ice sheets. But as the ice has shrunk, polar bears have been forced to swim longer and longer distances in the open ocean. This poses a severe danger during rough weather, and an increasing number of drowned polar bears have been observed.\nIn Hudson Bay, the ice breaks up three weeks earlier in the spring now than it did 20 years ago. Polar bears on Hudson Bay fast  during the summer, waiting for ice to form in the fall to hunt. Every year, the summer gets longer, and the bears get skinnier. Over the past 25 years, the average weight of the female bears has dropped 68 kg. This loss affects their ability to reproduce, and already the number of births has dropped 15 percent. Unless the bears can learn to survive these climate changes, these giants of the ice may one day disappear.",

It was a string of earthquakes that made the small town shake all the time.This went on for more than a year.Sometimes the quakes were very small.Only certain instruments could pick them up.At other times, the quakes damaged houses and land.The people were always afraid.They wished they knew how to stop the ground from shaking.\nPeople all over the world would like to know when an earthquake is coming.But an earthquake is almost always a surprise.Under the surface of the Earth, huge blocks of rock drift apart or slide against each other.The ground above splits apart or rumbles and shakes.\nSome scientists hope to predict quakes by keeping a close watch on animals.It seems that some animals can sense an earthquake coming.In 1969, animals in a Chinese zoo began to act funny one day.Swans flew out of their pond.A panda sat down, covered its eyes with its paws, and groaned.The animals seemed to know that something was about to happen.And it did.An earthquake struck.What was it that the animals sensed? Scientists are trying to find out.\nKeeping close track of the Earth's magnetic force in earthquake areas may also help.A few years ago, in Hollister, CA, scientists kept a record of the area's magnetic pull.For one week, the force grew stronger.Then it weakened suddenly.A day later, an earthquake struck.\nIt may become possible to know when and where an earthquake will happen.But it will be much harder to stop one from happening.\nMany scientists think that the Earth's covering is not smooth.They say the earth's \"skin\" is made up of huge puzzle pieces called plates.Land and ocean floors make up these huge plates.Under the Earth's crust  , or plates, is hot rock.The plates float on top of this rock.Sometimes the rock forces its way through the crust.What happens then? A volcano is born! More often, the rock moves and forces the plates to pull away from each other, causing earthquakes to happen.(Volcanoes and earthquakes often go together.)\nSometimes, the plates end up on top of each other.When this happens, the land above may look strange.Seen from the air, there seems to be a long scar in the Earth.This is called a fault  .The areas along faults have more earthquakes than other parts of the Earth.\nFor now, we'll just have to shake along with the Earth.It goes through millions of small earthquakes every year.With luck, you won't feel a thing!",

I'd push back hard if something didn't fit my world-view.\nIt's like I had to be first with an opinion -- as if being first meant something. But what it really meant was that I wasn't thinking hard enough about the problem. The faster you react, the less you think. Not always, but often.\nThis came to a head back in 2007. I was speaking at the Business Innovation Factory conference in Providence, RI. So was Richard Saul Wurman. After my talk Richard came up to introduce himself and compliment my talk. That was very generous of him. He certainly didn't have to do that.\nAnd what did I do? I pushed back at him about the talk he gave. While he was making his points on stage, I was taking an inventory of the things I didn't agree with. And when presented with an opportunity to speak with him, I quickly pushed back at some of his ideas. I must have seemed like such an asshole.\nHis response changed my life. It was a simple thing. He said \"Man, give it five minutes.\" I asked him what he meant by that? He said, it's fine to disagree, it's fine to push back, it's great to have strong opinions and beliefs, but give my ideas some time to set in before you're sure you want to argue against them. \"Five minutes\" represented \"think\", not react. He was totally right. I came into the discussion looking to prove something, not learn something.\nThis was a big moment for me.\nRichard has spent his career thinking about these problems. He's given it 30 years. And I gave it just a few minutes. Now, certainly he can be wrong and I could be right, but it's better to think deeply about something first before being so certain you're right.\nThere's also a difference between asking questions and pushing back. Pushing back means you already think you know. Asking questions means you want to know. Ask more questions.\nLearning to think first rather than react quick is a life-long pursuit. It's tough. I still get hot sometimes when I shouldn't. But I'm really enjoying all the benefits of getting better.\nIf you aren't sure why this is important, think about this quote from Jonathan Ive regarding Steve Jobs' reverence(respect) for ideas:\nAnd just as Steve loved ideas, and loved making stuff, he treated the process of creativity with a rare and a wonderful reverence. You see, I think he better than anyone understood that while ideas ultimately can be so powerful, they begin as fragile, barely formed thoughts, so easily missed, so easily compromised, so easily just squished.\nThat's deep. Ideas are fragile. They often start powerless. They're barely there, so easy to ignore or skip or miss.\nThere are two things in this world that take no skill: 1. Spending other people's money and 2. Dismissing an idea.\nDismissing an idea is so easy because it doesn't involve any work. You can scoff at it. You can ignore it. You can puff some smoke at it. That's easy. The hard thing to do is protect it, think about it, let it marinate, explore it, riff on it, and try it. The right idea could start out life as the wrong idea.\nSo next time you hear something, or someone, talk about an idea, pitch an idea, or suggest an idea, give it five minutes. Think about it a little bit before pushing back, before saying it's too hard or it's too much work.\nThose things may be true, but there may be another truth in there too: It may be worth it.",

So I had studied for about two hours the night before. After reviewing it for some time, I had started to understand it, so then I closed the book and  _ . However, it was not until midnight that I fell asleep. The next day, when I got the test, it might as well have been written in Serbian (which I don't know how to read). I tried my best to work out the hard problems, but the numbers I came up with were strange. I sat back on my chair and looked for any possible answers, but I could not remember anything or think correctly. I started thinking about my dad coming home from work to find that I failed the test ...\n\"How could you have failed the test? I am certain that nobody else in the whole class got as bad a grade as you did!\"\nNaturally I didn't want that to happen. My dad was also really busy at work at present, so I was afraid that this might make him mad. When feeling hopeless, I noticed that my table partner was writing fast on his test. I could see smoke rising up from how fast he was writing. I was attracted to look over at his test, but then the many bad results I had heard about cheating   came into my mind. I reasoned that if I started cheating now, it would be hard to give up that habit during high school. In the end, I decided not to copy his answers, and got a B- on that test. Even though my dad gave me a hard time about it, it would have been a lot worse if he found out that I had given in and cheated.",

Its wingspan seemed to be at least three times my height, which would have made it at least fourteen feet across.\nWhile the early childhood memory is often unreliable, I clearly remember the details of the  \"Thunderbird\".To this very day, I sometimes stand on my grandmother' s yard, eyeballing the old oak tree, but I have not yet seen another bird that resembles the giant bird.I have seen eagles, and hawks - but never another Thunderbird.\nOther modern sightings of what may have been thunderbirds have also occurred.In 1977, three boys were playing in a neighborhood in Illinois.They reported that two large birds chased after  them.One of the boys was attacked and suffered somewhat serious injuries, He was carried a few  feet off the ground, before the bird dropped him and disappeared into the wilderness.\nSeveral people interviewed the boys and their story remained the same, even under the pressure.the description of the birds somewhat matched the Andean condor ; however, these  massive condors have never been known to exist in the United States.\nAnother sighting came in 2002, in Alaska, when many people reported seeing a bird with a fourteen - foot wingspan.After being investigated, it was finally concluded that the bird was most likely a particularly large sea eagle, which typically has a wingspan of six to eight fickle.\nI will probably never know what the strange -looking giant bird from the oak tree was, and biologists will probably never be able to fully confirm the identity of the giant raptors spotted in Illinois and Alaska.If the Thunderbird does indeed exist, it will probably continue to remain mysterious.",

You'll grab your cell phone and open the diagnostics app.Inside your phone there will be a tiny microchip that uses X-ray waves to scan your body. The scan will reveal that your toe is just slightly hurt,not broken,which will convince you not to see a doctor.\n    After breakfast,your driverless car will take you to work.While you drive,your central computer system will suggest a list of chores your housekeeping robots could see to today and it will also remind you to buy a gift for your mother's upcoming birthday.\n    As you can see,with the help of advanced technologies,our lives will be more efficient. Teehnology will mitigate our forgetfulness and free us of many small burdens that distract us, such as buying a ticket or trying to remember our kids' parent-teacher meeting.Our brain will therefore be able to focus on more important things like preparing for a presentation or doing \"deep thinking\".\n    However,the development of technology might have some disadvantages as well.

Actually, it may be confirmed as a very crowded place by new computer models developed to help identify habitable planets.\nEstimates of places where life can exist have been based on the possibility of them having surface water. But software recently developed by the Aberdeen University allows researchers to identify planets with underground water kept liquid by heat from planets.\nWater is fundamental for life and planets too close to the sun lose water to the atmosphere through evaporation. On the other hand, planets located in distant reaches from their star have their surface water locked away as ice.\nSean McMahon, who is carrying out the work, explained: \"Traditionally people have said that if a planet is in this Goldilocks zone--not too hot and not too cold--then it can have liquid water on its surface and be habitable.\"\nBut this concept might change when considering that planets can receive two sources of heat--heat direct from the star and heat generated deep inside the planet.\nIt is easy to observe it in our own planet. As you go down through the crust   of the Earth, the temperature gets higher and higher. Even when the surface is frozen, water can exist below ground.\nThere could be immense quantities of water in fact--full of primitive life.\nProfessor John Parnell, also from Aberdeen University said: \"There is a significant habitat for microorganisms below the surface of the Earth, extending down several kilometres\".\n\"And some believe that the majority of life on Earth could even reside in this deep biosphere.\"\nSo the Aberdeen team are developing models to predict which distant planets might harbour underground reservoirs of liquid water with the possibility of alien life.",

        "passage": "\"A good parent\" can be a confusing phrase. It is almost impossible for one person to be \"a good parent\" at all stages of a child's life. Some parents are at their best before their children begin to speak. Others are most successful before their children enter elementary school. Still others make their finest contribution to older children or teenagers. Every parent can understand one stage of a child's development better than another. It is hard for a person to possess superior capacities throughout the entire period of a child's growth.\nA mother might be \"a good parent\" from her baby's birth until it is three; that is the period when it needs her protection and loving care. Then the start of her child's independence might upset and alarm her, and she might then become less helpful for a few years. A father might be awkward and uncomfortable with a younger child, but could turn into an excellent parent when the child is old enough to be taught the skills of cycling, fishing and so on, or to be taken on trips. Some parents feel easier with boys, and others with girls -- and then only at certain ages or stages.\nIt is important for parents to understand and accept their own limitations in these matters, just as they must accept the child's faults of personality and limitations of talent. Otherwise, fathers and mothers will feel guilty and blame themselves for weaknesses that may not be their faults. Much of the guilt experienced by modern parents comes from the mistaken feeling that they ought to be all things at all times to the child, which is clearly mistaken. In past ages, grandparents and uncles and aunts lived with the family, and provided different kinds of support; in our present \"nuclear\" family, too many roles are demanded of the two parents, which they cannot possibly fulfill.",

And when he played ball in his back yard, he just broke windows and got into trouble. So Davey began playing with a plastic golf ball and a broom handle for a bat.\nWhen his dad, David Mullaney, a former semi-pro baseball pitcher , realized his son was hurting his arm trying to throw curves with the little plastic ball, he decided to find a better solution. Mullaney got a bunch of hollow plastic _ from a local factory, sat down at his kitchen table and began cutting different size holes in the balls with a razor knife. He thought maybe the holes would alter the ball's flight and help his son throw curves and sliders without hurting his arm.\nAll the balls failed--except the one with the eight oblong  holes cut into one of the hemispheres. This ball curved naturally and sharply without a violent snap of the wrist. In fact, Davey was now striking out so many batters; he called his new ball a \"wiffle ball\". A year later, Mullaney borrowed $20,000 from family and friends and started producing Wiffle Balls in his little suburban town of Shelton, Connecticut.\n\"I didn't want investors.\" He said, \"I wanted to control my own company.\" This was the beginning of one of the hottest fads  of the fifties and a perennial  best seller well known all around the world. Since then millions of boys and girls have enjoyed countless hours of safe, wholesome fun playing with a Wiffle ball and bat. Esquire Magazine has even called the Wiffle Ball \"a national treasure\". By producing a high quality product at an affordable price, three generations of Mullany's have enjoyed the satisfaction and benefits of running a successful and profitable family business.\nOver the years, they've had plenty of offers to buy them out, but they're still working out of a small factory in Shelton, making a new Wiffle Ball every couple of seconds. Creativity and persistence are two of the important sources for wealth. If he gave up his attempts at trying new things, Mullany would not have invented the wiffle ball, nor would he have made such a big fortune.",

The woman in the house saw a mouse crawl  into the house in the moonlight. \"Look! In comes one,\" she said to the man in the house. The thief was so frightened that he hurriedly crawled out of the house and said to the one waiting outside, \"She found me when I was just in.\" But the thief outside didn't believe him, so he said, \"Let us try to crawl into the house together.\" At that time two mice happened to crawl into the house, too. The woman saw the mice and shouted, \"In come two, catch them!\" The two thieves were terribly frightened. The man in the house said, \"You saw them come in but where are they? I will catch them tonight.\" The two thieves started running away at once.\nThe two thieves wanted to make it clear whether they had been found or not the night before. The next day they acted as men selling sweet potatoes and came before the house. The man and the woman were ploughing in their fields. The rope broke and the woman came home for a rope. She saw two men selling sweet potatoes and wanted to buy some. She picked out two which looked like mice. At the time the man couldn't wait for her any longer in the fields and he ran back from the fields to hurry her up. The woman showed the sweet potatoes to the man and said, \"How they look like the two of last night.\" The man said, \"I asked you to fetch a rope, why don't you hurry for it?\" The two thieves ran away very quickly without their sweet potatoes.",

        "passage": "\"Now I just don't believe that.\" Surely all of us, at some point, have watched a movie and thought: It's simply badly researched, or, the makers must think we're fools.\nIf movies were completely scientifically accurate, they'd probably be as interesting as a Physics 101 lecture. In real life, there are no explosions in space, gas usually doesn't explode from a lit cigarette, and Bruce Willis / Jackie Chan / Will Smith would most likely be in a coma  after getting kicked in the head.\nRecently, the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph ran a humorous piece on unconvincing tech moments from some top movies. Let's see what _ are all about.\nTelegraph writer Tom Chivers' first example is from the end-of-the-world movie Independence Day, in which a character comes up with a virus capable of destroying Windows, the computer system the alien  spacecraft uses. \"It's a good thing they didn't have Norton antivirus,\" jokes Chivers.\nIt's just one case of a movie that takes a lot of license with its science. Another one Chivers mentions is from Star Wars, where glowing beams of light traveling through space look very impressive. The problem is that in space there are no air particles  for the light to reflect off. In reality, they'd not be seen, which wouldn't look so cool on the big screen.\nChivers' second piece of Star Wars nonsense is the sound the fighters make in the movies: \" the bellow  of an elephant mixed with a car driving on a wet road\". But sound needs a medium to travel through, like air. In space, there wouldn't actually be any sound at all.\nFew people would deny that the mind-bending Matrix films make for great viewing, but for Chivers, the science in the movies is a little silly.\nAnd finally: as Chivers points out, DAN is not replaceable. But this bit of elementary genetics passed the makers of the 2002 Bond film Die another Day by. In the film the villain  has \"gene therapy\" to change his appearance and his DNA, which is completely impossible.",

It puts out the flames. The usual response to clothing catching on fire is to run around and run about wildly, which only exposes the fire to more oxygen and feeds the flames. Your children should also know to touch door handles before opening the door to see if they are hot.

Fires started by playing with these things are the leading cause of fire-related injuries in children under five years old.  Many children are fascinated by lighters and matches and want to experiment with lighting things on fire to see what happens.\nDo regular fire drills to practice your evacuation plan so that your family knows what to do in an emergency.

        "passage": "People with disabilities make up a large part of the population. It is estimated  that over 35 million Americans have physical, mental, or other disabilities. About half of these disabilities are \"developmental\", i.e., they occur before the individual's twenty-second birthday, often from genetic conditions, and are severe enough to affect three or more areas of development, such as mobility, communication, employment, etc. Most other disabilities are considered \"adventitious\", i.e., accidental or caused by outside forces.\nPrior to the 20th century, only a small percentage of people with disabilities survived for long. Medical treatment for these disabilities was unavailable. Advancements in medicine and social services have created a climate in which people with disabilities can expect to have such basic needs as food, shelter, and medical treatment. Unfortunately, these basics are often not available. Civil liberties such as the right to vote, marry, get an education, and gain employment have historically been denied on the basis of disability.\nIn recent decades, the disability rights movement has been organized to fight against these infringements(;)of civil rights. Congress responded by passing major legislation recognizing people with disabilities as a protected class under civil rights statutes.\nStill today, people with disabilities must fight to live their lives independently. It is estimated that more than half of qualified Americans with disabilities are unemployed, and a majority of those who do work are underemployed. About two-thirds live at or below the official poverty level.\nSignificant barriers, especially in transportation and public awareness, prevent disabled people from taking part in society. For example, while no longer prohibited by law from marrying, a person with no access to transportation is effectively excluded from community and social activities which might lead to the development of long-term relationships.\nOnly when public attitudes advance as far as laws have will disabled people be fully able to take their rightful place in society.",

We've been going to the same spot in the Pacific Ocean, and we try and characterize long-term change in the open ocean environment. And one of the key things that we measure is CO2levels. And we've been able to record this increasing quantity of atmospheric CO2into the ocean.\nScientists expected that as atmospheric CO2increased, more and more of the carbon dioxide would be absorbed into the ocean, affecting the chemical balance of the sea water, with a potentially harmful impact on shellfish and coral in particular.\n\"As carbon dioxide dissolves  in the water, or seawater in this case, it forms a weak acid, carbonic acid,\" Dore explains. \"And therefore, as the concentration of CO2in the atmosphere goes up and that exchanges with the surface seawater, it drives the PH down, and makes it more acidic.\"\nThe seawater Dore and his colleagues have analyzed confirms what the theory predicts.\nThe effect was particular striking at about 250 meters down, and again at 500 meters. Dore and his colleagues came up with two possible explanations. It could be that surface water picked up CO2and then moved to those depths. Or there could be a biological explanation.\n\"It's important to realize that the oceans are really becoming acidic. And it can have negative  impacts on a whole variety of sea life from fish to coral. It's potentially catastrophic.\"",

The Natural Zoo has given people the chance to adopt animals by paying for all of its food for one year. One of the animals that needed parents was a young tiger named Brocky. The people at the zoo said that it would cost about $900 a year for the food for Brocky.\nNot many boys and girls have $900 to spend. That is why several hundred children and grown-ups each have sent a little money to the zoo to help pay for Brocky's food. Some children sent in only a quarter because that was all the money they had. Other children sent in more money than that.\nSince so many people sent money to the zoo to help pay for Brocky's food, he now will be able to eat as much as he wants. Brocky surely must be a happy tiger to know that he has so many adopted parents. Many children must also be happy to know that they have helped to feed him. It really will be thrilling for those children to go to the Natural Zoo to visit their adopted tiger Brocky.",

        "passage": "The U.S. Department of Labor statistics  show that there is an oversupply of college trained workers and that this oversupply is increasing. Already there have been more than enough teachers, engineers, physicists, aerospace experts, and other specialists. Yet colleges and graduate schools continue every year to turn out highly trained people to compete for jobs that aren't there. The result is that graduates cannot enter the professions for which they were trained and must take temporary jobs which do not require a college degree.\nOn the other hand, there is a great need for skilled workers of all sorts: carpenters, electricians, mechanics, plumbers, TV repairmen. These people have more work than they can deal with, and their annual incomes are often higher than those of college graduates. The old gap that white --collar workers make a better living than blue collar workers no longer holds true. The law of supply and demand now favors the skilled workmen.\nThe reason for this situation is the traditional myth that college degree is a passport to a prosperous future. A large part of American society matches success in life equally with a college degree. Parents begin indoctrinating  their children with this myth before they are out of grade school. High school teachers play their part by acting as if high school education were a preparation for college rather than for life. Under this pressure the kids fall in line. Whether they want to go to college or not doesn't matter. Everybody should go to college, so of course they must go. And every year college enrollments  go up and up, and more and more graduates are overeducated for the kinds of jobs available to them.\nOne result of this emphasis on a college education is that _ . Of the sixty percent of high school graduates who enter college, half of them do not graduate with their class. Many of them drop out within the first year.

        "passage": "The dirt road made our car jump as we traveled to the Millennium Village in Sauri, Kenya. We passed the market where women sat on the dusty ground selling bananas. Little kids were wrapped in cloth on their mothers' backs, or running around in bare feet and torn clothing. When we reached the village, we walked to the Bar Sauri Primary School to meet the people. Welcoming music and singing had almost everyone dancing. We joined the dancing and clapped along to the joyful, lively music. The year was 2004, the first time I had ever been to Sauri.\nThe Millennium Village project was created to help reach the Millennium Development Goals, which were set by the United Nations in 2000. The plan is to get people out of poverty, assure them of access to health care and help them stabilize the economy and quality of life in their communities. The goals are supposed to be met by 2015; some other targets are set for 2025. But our first sight of Sauri showed us there was plenty of work to do.\nOn that day in 2004, we followed the village leaders into Yala Sub-District Hospital. It wasn't in good shape. The rooms were packed with patients who probably wouldn't receive treatment, either because the hospital did not have it or the patients could not afford it. There was no running water or electricity in the hospital. It is hard for me to see people sick with preventable diseases who are near death when they shouldn't have to be. I just get scared and sad.\nMalaria is one disease, common in Africa, which is preventable and treatable. Mosquitoes carry malaria, and infect people by biting them. Kids can die from it easily, and adults get very sick. Mosquitoes that carry malaria come at night. A mosquito net, treated with chemicals that last for five years, keeps malarial mosquitoes away from sleeping people. Each net costs $5. There are some cheap medicines to get rid of malaria too. The solutions are simple, yet 20,000 kids die from the disease each day. So sad, and so illogical. Mosquito nets could save millions of lives.\nWe walked over to see the farmers. Their crops started to die because they could not afford the necessary fertilizer and irrigation. Time and again, a family will plant seeds only to have an outcome of poor crops because of lack of fertilizer and water. Each year, the farmers worry: Will they harvest enough food to feed the whole family? Will their kids go hungry and become sick?\nMany kids in Sauri didn't attend school because their parents couldn't afford school fees. Some kids are needed to help with housework, such as fetching water and wood. In 2004, the schools had _ supplies like books paper and pencils, but the students wanted to learn. They all worked hard with the few supplies they had. It was hard for them to concentrate, though, as there's no midday meal.\nGreat changes have taken place in these years. Today, Yala Sub-District Hospital has medicine, free of charge. Water is connected to the hospital, which also has a generator for electricity. There are no school fees, and the school now serves midday meals for the students. The attendance rate is way up. All this is encouraging supporters of the Millennium Villages project.\nThere are many solutions to the problems that keep people poor. What it will really take is for the world to work together to change poor areas forever. When my kids are my age, I want this kind of poverty to be a thing of history. It will not be an easy task. But Sauri's progress shows us all that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime.",

Or someone who does not usually like to go to the beach might say \"I visit the shore once in a moon.\" While many people use this phrase, not everyone knows the meaning behind it.\nThe first thing to know is that the moon itself is never really blue. This is just an expression. In fact, the phrase \"blue moon\" has to do with the shape of the moon, not the color.\nAs the moon travels around the earth, it appears to change shape. We associate names with certain shapes of the moon. For example, when we can see a small part of the moon, it is called a crescent moon. A crescent is a shape that looks like the tip of a fingernail. When we cannot see the moon at all, it is called a new moon. When we can see the whole moon, it is called a full moon. Usually, there is only one full moon every month. Sometimes, however, there will be two full moons in one month. When this happens, the second full moon is called a \"blue moon\".\nOver the next 20 years, there will only be 15 blue moons.

Still, I was struck by a report which concluded that today's children are significantly more anxious than children in the 1950s. In fact, the analysis showed, normal children aged 9 to 17 exhibit a higher level of anxiety today than children who were treated for mental illness 50 years ago.\nWhy are America's kids so stressed? The report cites two main causes: increasing physical isolation  brought on by high divorce rates and less involvement in community, among other things and a growing perception that the world is a more dangerous place.\nConsidering that we can't turn the clock back, adults can still do plenty to help the next generation.\nAt the top of the list is nurturing  a better appreciation of the limits of individualism. No child is an island. Strengthening social ties helps build communities and protect individuals against stress.\nTo help kids build stronger connections with others, you can pull the plug on TVs and computers. Your family will thank you later. They will have more time for facetoface relationships, and they will get more sleep.\nLimit the amount of virtual  violence your children are exposed to.

Countries that have a lot of earthquakes are usually quite mountainous.\n         The most talked about earthquake in the United States was in San Francisco in 1906. Over 700 people died in it. The strongest one in North America was in 1964. It happened in Alaska.\n         Strong earthquakes are not always the ones that kill the most people. In 1755, one of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded was felt in Portugal. Around 2,000 people died. In 1923, a very strong earthquake hit Tokyo, the Yokohama area of Japan. A hundred and forty thousand people died. Most of them died in fires which followed the earthquake.\n         One of the worst earthquakes ever was in China in 1976. It killed a large number of people. The worst earthquake ever recorded was also in China, in which 400,000 people were killed or injured. This earthquake happened in 1556.\n         Earthquakes worry people a lot. The reason is that we often do not know when they are coming. People can not prepare for it. Although we cannot stop earthquakes, there are things which can be done to protect ourselves during an earthquake.",

Organizers said the voyage was made to protect Taiwanese fishing rights in nearby waters and to protest Japan's \"purchase\" of part of the Diaoyu Islands.\nThe Japanese government announced a plan to \"purchase\" part of the islands earlier this month despite repeated protests from the Chinese government.

Coding is all about creativity and music and creating art Crearbing with code CoderDojo helps young perople around the world to learn computer  programming for free. When I went to my first CoderDojo class in Dublin City University in Ireland, at age nine, I didn't know anything about coding or even what it was. But I remember making my very first web page that first day, and being surprised that I could create such a thing. It was a great feeling that I think every young person should experience!\nBy going to CoderDojo every week, I learned how to make websites, apps and games. One of my apps is called Auto-Journalist. It can help journalists   and interwewees do interviews even if they are both really busy or live in different time zones. It is still in development, and I have showed it at an event called Coolest Projects Awards, where young people get to show the public what they have created with code. It's so mucbt fun to share one's creations, and to see what everyone else has made too.\nLearnuing environment\nFor the past three years I have also been helping to teach other young people at CoderDojo DCU. In recent years I have also noticed many more girls attending CoderDojo DCU to try out coding. This has a lot to do with the CoderDojo girls' classes -- girls and young women take part in it with their friends, and it doesn't feel like coding is a \"boy thing\". It is really wonderful to see this, because we need more girls and women in STEM ( Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths). It's a good way to leam more about technology.\nStart early\nOne of the main things I have leamed in the last few years is that coding is not only for adults, coding is for young people, too. And when you are a child it is a great time to start coding, because your imagination is the limit for what you can create !\nWant to leam more?

But when British people say that their society is based on family life, they are thinking of \"family\" in its narrow, peculiarly European sense of mother ,father and children living together alone in their own house as an economic and social unit. Thus, every British marriage indicates the beginning of a new and independent family--hence the tremendous importance of marriage in British life. For both the man and the woman, marriage means leaving one's parents and starting one's own life. The man's first duty will then be to his wife, and the wife's to her husband. He will be entirely responsible for her financial support, and she for the running of the new home. Their children will be their common responsibility and theirs alone. Neither the wife's parents nor the husband's, nor their brothers or sisters, aunts or uncles, have any right to interfere with them--they are their own masters.\nReaders of novels like Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice will know that in former times marriage among wealthy families were arranged by the girl's parents, that is, it was the parents' duty to find a suitable husband for their daughter, preferably a rich one, and by skillful encouragement to lead him eventually to ask their permission to marry her. Until that time, the girl was protected and maintained in the parents' home, and the financial relief of getting rid of her could be seen in their giving the newly married pair a sum of money called a dowry. It is very different today. Most girls of today get a job when they leave school and become financially independent before their marriage. This has had two results. A girl chooses her own husband, and she gets no dowry.",

What we have done is to create several generations of individuals most of whom have no idea how to reason; how to do simple math; how to do research; or, finally, how to be creative . The reason for this is our overuse of information technology: video games, television, digital watches, calculators, and computers. Information technology feeds us information without requiring us to think about it and let us perform operations without understanding them.    \nIt is time we took a hard look at an educational system that only teaches our children how to push buttons. Our kids can't tell time if the clock has hands. They can use calculators, but cannot add, subtract , divide, or multiply. Video games have taken the place of active, imaginative play. Although most of them are technically educated, they choose not to read. They are so used to television and movies that they cannot use their imagination to stay interested in a book.    \n     Therefore, we must do something to help our children. If we don't, they will never learn how to solve problems. They will never learn even basic reasoning skills and will certainly not develop creativity. Instead of filling classrooms with electronics, let's concentrate on good old-fashioned literacy -- reading books. Students must see how things work and how processes lead to results, and they must also stretch their imagination.",

I remember Dad pushing the tiller  ahead in perfectly straight lines. Dad loved growing all sorts of things: yellow and green onions, watermelons almost as big as me, rows of yellow corn, and our favorite--- red tomatoes.\nAs I grew into a teenager, I didn't get so excited about gardening with Dad. Instead of magical land of possibility, it had turned into some kind of prison. As Dad grew older, his love for gardening never disappeared. After all the kids were grown and had started families of their own, Dad turned to gardening like never before. Even when he was diagnosed with cancer, he still took care of his garden.\nBut then, the cancer, bit by bit, invaded his body. I had to do the things he used to do. What really convinced me that Dad was dying was the state of his garden that year. The rows and rows of multicolored vegetables were gone. Too tired to weed them, he simply let them be. He only planted tomatoes.\nFor the first few years after he died, I couldn't even bear to look at anyone's garden without having strong memories pour over me like cold water from a bucket. Three years ago, I decided to plant my own garden and started out with just a few tomatoes. That morning, after breaking up a fair amount of soil, something caught the corner of my eye and I had to smile. It was my eight-year-old son Nathan, happily playing in the freshly tilled soil.",

Thrill-seekers like me are in luck because theme parks are pushing the boundaries of technology to create the fastest, tallest, scariest roller coasters the world has ever known.\nAlton Towers in Britain opened the world's first 14-1oop roller coaster a few months ago, called The Smiler. Over in Abu Dhabi, Ferrari World claims to have the world's fastest one. Ferrari World's Formula Rossa ride sends out passengers from 0-240km/h in just 4. 9 seconds. During this rapid acceleration they experience G-forces only fighter pilots usually  feel: Up to 4. 8G. The designer of several rides at Alton Towers, said: \"While we can stand 6-8Gs for very short periods of  time, ff we experience 5G for more than five seconds we're likely to \"black out.\"\nOn modern roller coasters passengers experience about 3G in tight turns and loops. But while we may have reached the limit in terms of G-forces, there is no technological limit to how fast or how high roller coasters can go---it's all down to money. Alton Towers' The Smiler cost ~18m to build.\nSome companies are finding other ways to keep us amused. There's a move towards indoor rides where the experience is improved by audio-visual technologies. For example, a company called Dynamic Structures is currently developing a \"coal-mine-themed\" ride for a client in Dubai that will combine speed and G-forces with 3D projection effects and robotics, which will trick your brain into thinking you're really falling.\nI can't wait to enjoy this one.

Kovar, a tree-climbing instructor, recently returned to the U.S. from Brazil, where he spent time developing a tree-climbing operation thanks to the \"slow travel\" movement.\n   Slow travel, is like the slow food movement, the practice of giving fast food in favor of homegrown cooking--the kind that takes hours to prepare and enjoy. Likewise, slow travel urges visitors to experience a place's natural surroundings and learn about the ecology in a way not afforded by extreme games. \n   \"Tree climbing is a slow activity,\" says Kovar. \"It's not something you do quickly and then you're on to the next thing or event.\" There is no such thing as a quick climb, especially for beginners. This wasn't a race against the clock or the fellow climbers. In fact, tree climbing is unlikely to ever become a feature of the extreme games. Many climbers refuse competition. There has already been so much competition in the world.\n\"When you stand below the tree, it can be amazing,\" Rusel DeMaria says, looking affectionately up at Michael's Triumph, a 150-foot-tall tree. But reaching the treetop, he adds, is an entirely different feeling. Likewise, his wife, Viola Brumbaugh, kneels on the ground and asks Michael's Triumph for permission to climb. \"It goes a lot smoother that way, \"She says.\nAnd climbing has been included into many educational programs. New Tribe offers guided climbs through its school, Tree Climbing Northwest, where \"we teach enough tree biology and forest ecology to raise awareness in our students,\" says New Tribe present Sophis Sparks. \"We know that the tree climbing experience deepens personal appreciation for trees. After climbing, people value trees more and are motivated to support preservation. This is not just to preserve their playground.\"\n   Perhaps that is why he struggles with the term \"recreational tree climbing,\" saying, \"I prefer to call it inspirational tree climbing.\"",

In the past, this main meal was served at around 3:00 p.m. But now people work longer hours and eat when they get home at around 6:00 p.m. Dinner parties are held later, around 9:00 p.m.\nMost Egyptian meals include bread or ice, cooked vegetables and beans or meat.\nFrance\nFrance is known for its fine cooking, and its people take food seriously. Most eat three meals a day at fixed times and never snack between meals. Breakfast is a light meal of bread and coffee. They eat lunch at around 1:00 p.m. and a dinner with multiple courses after 8:00 p.m.\nThe French consider eating a social activity. Eating alone is hard to see, and eating while doing something else is unheard-of. The French take time to enjoy their meals and visitors should do the same.\nBrazil\nLike the French, Brazilians usually eat a light breakfast. Lunch, the largest meal of the day, usually consists of meat, rice, potatoes, beans and vegetables. Between 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m., people enjoy a smaller meal with their families.\nBrazilians don't mind eating a hurried or light meal and sometimes buy food from street carts  .

Some take time to prepare and eat a hot breakfast. Others take a bagel   while rushing out the door or just _ . For lunch, most Americans eat a sandwich or leftovers.

        "passage": "If you are thinking of putting your child in a private high school instead of a public one, you should do some research. You will find that most private schools offer some advantages.\nOne of the most important details of a good high school is small class size. Many public schools might have 30 or even 35 students in each class. However, many private schools limit the size to about 15 to 20 kids per class. This is a good thing because it allows each teacher to offer every student more attention.\nAnother thing to mention is the interesting classes. For example, while the typical   high school might only offer Spanish and French as foreign languages, private schools often have several other languages to choose from. This is especially important if your child is actually interested in studying a particular language that is not usually offered. Of course, many colleges also consider the various   classes as a good thing, since they can teach students more different subjects than usual.\nSome colleges actually work closely with schools to make sure students are prepared well to get an advanced education. This means that teachers are careful to teach skills that can be used in college. Also, college teachers may be on-hand to talk to students and give them advice. If you think your child could use some help of this kind, which would likely help prepare him or her for college, you should look into schools offering these things.\nA simple visit to the website or campus   of a local private high school could give you the answers you are looking for. If you think your child would benefit from and appreciate these advantages, you should start researching. You are sure to find at least _ that offers these benefits.",

Qingming Jie was proclaimed a Chinese national holiday in 2008. It is a time for remembering loved ones who have departed  . People visit their ancestors' graves to sweep away the dirt and get rid of any weeds. They also leave offerings   of food and flowers, and burn incense   and paper money. Chinese tombs are usually built in the woods or on mountains, far from the city. It is believed that an area that faces south, with many pine trees, is a proper place for a tomb. People believe such a place will make the ancestors happy, and in return, they will look after the living family.\nNowadays, more and more residents are choosing environmental-friendly ways to spend the holiday such as flower sacrifices and memorial ceremonies on the Internet or at home. As one of the traditional ways to celebrate Tomb-sweeping Day - burning paper or incense - isn't exactly good for air quality.\nIn contrast to the sadness of the tomb sweepers, people also enjoy hope of Spring on this day. The Qingming Festival is a time when the sun shines brightly, the trees and grass become green and nature is again lively. Since ancient times, people have followed the custom of Spring outings. At this time tourists are everywhere.\nMany people fly kites on Tomb Sweeping Day. They are usually made from a bamboo crossbow with coloured paper. The kite vibrates and buzzes as it rises into the sky, counterbalanced by its tail. Large kites can be as broad as three metres across, with a tail of six to ten metres. Most kites have a rectangular shape, and many have patterns of crabs, centipedes, butterflies, dragonflies, or Chinese characters such as \"good fortune\" or \"long life\". (361words)",

But can medicine come packaged in chicken eggs?\nA team of scientists from Scotland say \"yes\". They've engineered special chickens that lay eggs with disease-treating drugs inside.\nThese eggs come from chickens that have been engineered to produce certain drugs inside their egg whites.\nThese drugs are made of molecules called proteins . Animals make thousands of proteins -- they're the main element in skin, hair, milk and meat. Since animals can make proteins easily, they're good candidates   for making protein drugs.\nResearchers have already made cows, sheep and goats produce protein drugs in their milk. But chickens are cheaper to take care of, need less room, and grow faster than these other animals. Those qualities could make chickens a better choice to become living drug factories, says Simon Lillico of the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh, Scotland.\nLillico and a team of researchers changed chickens' DNA -- the code that tells cells how to make proteins -- so that the birds' cells made two protein drugs. One drug can treat skin cancer, and the other treats a nerve disease called multiple sclerosis  .\nThe scientists changed the chickens' DNA so that the birds made these drugs only in their egg whites. This protects the chickens' bodies from the drugs' possible harmful effects and makes it easy for scientists to collect the drugs.",

        "passage": "Never before in Chinese history has a documentary film aroused so much public enthusiasm. Everybody is talking about a new 7-part documentary called A Bite of China which was recently broadcast late at night on CCTV I. The documentary describes various _ across the vast Chinese culinary   landscape.\nAccording to Taobao, China's biggest online retail website, just five days after the series began to air, nearly 6 million people went to the site in search of various local specialties, particularly those mentioned in the documentary. More than 7.2 million deals were concluded. A ham producer from Yunnan Province saw his sales grow 17-fold in five days.\nHowever, one can't help but believe that the documentary's popularity is probably linked to the endless stream of terrible food security issues that have emerged in recent years. In one well-received article, a netizen wrote, \"I wonder how many felt so empty-hearted and sighed after watching the film. Blue-vitriol watered chive, formaldehyde  sprayed cabbage, Sudan Red colored salty eggs, restaurants using gutter oil. The list is long...\"\nA varied and ancient food culture that is famous world-wide and which should have made the Chinese proud ends like this: one can only sigh. Food is the most vital thing in people's lives. Yet China's food industry is a typical description of \"bad money driving out the good\".The market is huge while the cost of faking and cheating is so low for unscrupulous   businessmen; and the punishment is too light. Take the milk industry as an example. Although Sanlu, the company that sold the melamine-adulterated milk powder, was punished, thousands of other dairies didn't work hard to improve the quality. In order to allow national brands to survive, Chinese authorities are happy to loosen their regulations.\nAs the documentary shows, people are attracted not to gourmet items like matsutake, a species of rare mushroom grown naturally in remote forests, but to common Chinese dishes like barley, lotus root or tofu. They are what meet our basic needs. This explains why people are so excited about A Bite of China---it is a reminder that there is still a world out there where food is excellent and people have dignity.",

Dr Elizabeth Hartnell-Young and her colleagues have reached this conclusion after studying the consequences of allowing pupils in five secondary schools to use either their own mobile phones or the new generation of 'smartphones' in lessons.\nDuring the nine-month experiment, 14- to-16-year-old pupils used the phones for a wide range of educational purposes, including creating short movies, setting homework reminders, recording a teacher reading a poem, and timing experiments with the phones' stopwatches. The smartphones, which could be connected to the Internet, also allowed pupils to access revision websites, log into the school email system, or transfer   electronic files between school and home.\nThe research involved 331 pupils in schools in Cambridgeshire, West Berkshire and Nottingham. \"At the start of the study, even pupils were often surprised at the thought that mobile phones could be used for learning,\" Dr Hartnell-Young said. \"After their hands-on experience, almost all pupils said they had enjoyed the project and felt more inspired.\"\nSome teachers found that pupils who lacked confidence gained most from the project.

Whitehill's achievement marked a major step forward in the way people could one day learn by establishing facial expression recognition in robot teachers.\n     The teaching robots or, Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) are computer systems that provide personalized instruction and feedback to students without human intervention. The facial expression recognition allows a computer to react according to expressions a user makes.\n     He said that the system was an important development in improving learning systems.\n\"Classical ITS typically have a somewhat rigid architecture of 'first I ask a questions then I wait for a responses then I talk some more; then I wait for another response.' Facial expression recognition, I believe, will allow the feedback from student to teacher to happen while the robot teacher is talking,\" Whitehill said.\n     Experts agree the latest developments in ITS open new possibilities for how people could learn. University of Memphis researcher, Dr Andrew Olney, who recently received a US$ I. 3 million grant to develop an ITS, said the key to future learning will be enabling interactive , one-on-one instruction.\n     \"The technology can benefit these more advanced learning scenarios ,\" he said.\n     Although robot teachers of varying abilities have existed for more than 30 years, ITS developments such as Whitehill's and Olney's are pushing beliefs that robots could soon be as effective as-- if not more effective than human teachers.\n     \"The ITS which have been developed are already better teachers than people who have no experience,\" Olney said.\n     So, what is the future for today's teachers, classrooms, and textbooks?",

        "passage": "Are you a big fan of pirate  stories? Do you know how to talk like a pirate? You can have fun on September 19th. This special holiday is called International Talk Like A Pirate Day. It was invented in 1995 by two young Americans, John Baur and Mark Summers.\nThese two good friends came up with this idea when they were playing racquetball, and began to talk like pirates. At that moment, they thought, \"Young people are interested in pirate, but there is no such a chance for people to get together to share it. Why not have a day when everybody talks like a pirate?\" They decided to make September 19th the date. Since then, Baur and Summers have tried hard to promote Talk Like A Pirate Day. As Baur said, \"We've talked like pirates, and encouraged several of our friends to do so every September 19th.\"\nAt first, this day was only known by a few people. In 2002, Baur and Summers sent a letter about their invented holiday to Dave Barry. This columnist really liked their idea. He promoted the holiday and made it known to more and more people. Now, it has really become an international holiday. On Talk Like A Pirate Day, you need to dress like a pirate. You should wear a big hat or maybe cover one of your eyes. You can pretend to be any kind of pirate that you can find in any story or movie.\nHaving fun and being relaxed are not the only best things about the holiday. Young people share the same interest and childhood dreams that day. That's why it is welcomed by so many people, especially young people.\nUnlike traditional holidays, International Talk Like A Pirate Day is a brand new holiday which is invented by the youth themselves and celebrated by themselves too. Because of Baur and Summers' imagination and creativity, thousands of young people's pirate dream come true. Next time, when you have a good idea, why not share it with your fiends and insist on your belief? Maybe you can create another wonderful holiday for the youth in the future.",

During their visit, the conversation turned to complaints about stress in their work and lives.\nOffering his guests hot chocolate, the professor went into the kitchen and returned with a large pot of hot chocolate and other things including cups-porcelain , glass, crystal, some plain looking, some expensive, some elegant -- telling them to help themselves to the hot chocolate.\nWhen they all had a cup of hot chocolate in hand, the professor said: \"I notice that all the nice looking and expensive cups were taken, leaving behind the plain and cheap ones. While it is normal for you to want only the best for yourselves, that is the source of your problems and stress. The cup that you're drinking from adds nothing to the quality of the hot chocolate. In most cases it is just more expensive and in some cases even hides what we drink. What all of you really wanted was hot chocolate, not the cup; but you consciously went for the best cups... And then you began eyeing each others cups. Now consider this: Life is the hot chocolate; your job, money and position in society are the cups. They are just tools to hold and contain life. The cup you have does not define, nor change the quality of life you have. Sometimes, by concentrating only on the cup, we fail to enjoy the hot chocolate we have. The happiest people don't have the best of everything. They just make the best of everything that they have. Live simply. Love generously. Care deeply. Speak kindly. Thank the Lord for your blessings in 2011. And enjoy your hot chocolate in 2012!\"",

        "passage": "Being young is great. Most of the parts of your body still work great, you have a full head of hair, you're energetic, and you have a world of opportunity in front of you. However, there's going to come a time when you start to get older. And as you get older, you'll have new responsibilities, complete independence, and perhaps most importantly, less time to recover from mistakes.\nYou see, we all make mistakes in life. Maybe you spent more money than you should have on a car, you passed up on a great job opportunity, or you didn't try as hard as you could have in school. It's a part of life and we learn from it. But there are certain mistakes that are much better made while you're still young and have plenty of time to recover.\nI'm definitely not telling you that you should purposely go out and make these mistakes (because they're a pain to recover from). But these are all mistakes that are much better made when you're younger so that you can learn from them and not have them ruin your entire life.\nStarting the wrong career\nWouldn't you hate to be 45 years old and discover that you absolutely hate what you do for a living? It's a reality that a lot of people face and it can be difficult to fix. You see, when you're 23 and find out you don't like the career path you've chosen, you can easily explore new career options.\nWe no longer live in an age when people are expected to stay with one company until they retire. You can bounce around a little bit and find out what you want to do. When you get older, just switching careers whenever you want isn't as simple.\nYou have to consider your family, retirement, the difficulties you might run into with starting from the bottom in a new industry, and plenty of other issues that someone in their early 20's just doesn't have to deal with.\nDating the wrong person\nThe divorce rate in the U.S is extremely high. Other parts of the world aren't doing too much better either. While everyone gets divorced for their own reasons, I think we can all agree that it's better to find out that the person you're with is wrong for you sooner rather than later.\nHopefully you find out whether or not the person you're with is right for you before you tie the knot, because around 50% of first marriages end in divorce.\nMessing up your credit\nRuining your credit is never a good idea. Even if you ruin it while you're young, it could affect you in the future. The upside of having bad credit while you're young instead of older is that you have time to build it back up.\nIt can take 7-10 years to rebuild your credit if you have a history of late payments, loan defaults, foreclosures, or bankruptcy. During those 7-10 years, you'll have a hard time financing anything unless you have a cosigner or put down a substantial down payment.\nMost people tend to make most of the bigger purchases in life when they get older such as a house or their dream car. If you have bad credit, you can kiss all of that goodbye.\nMaking bad investments\nIf you're investing money for your retirement, making bad decisions can mean you'll be working your entire life. Whether you choose to pay someone to do the investing for you or handle it all yourself, it's a lot better to take risks when you're younger.\nIf you invest in stock or even real estate while you're young and the market takes a hit, you're not ruined. Investing is a long-term venture, so the younger you start, the more fluctuation you can withstand and still come out with a positive return.\nBlowing your money\nWhat would you do if you went broke at 60 years old? You would be working your behind off when you really should be relaxing and getting ready to retire soon.\nBut if you're 25 and broke, you still have plenty of time to earn more money. Also, nobody will judge you because it's not unusual for people in their 20's to not have money these days. You might have blown your money on a nice car or have an obsession with all the newest gadgets.\nWhen you get older, you'll be able to look back and realize how dumb you were for spending $20,000 on a brand new car when you were only 20 years old. But when you're older and waste your money, you'll REALLY have nothing to show for it.",

And many teenagers find that earning their own money gives them a sense of pride and freedom.\nThe US Department of Labor allows teenagers to apply for jobs at the age of 14. Popular part-time jobs include working in ice cream stores, coffee shops, and clothing stores. During the school year, teenagers may go to work a few times a week after their classes get out, then work for longer on the weekends.\nIn the summer, top jobs for teens include working at camps, swimming pools and amusement parks. These jobs are great for young people who want to be active and have fun while making money.\nA favorite job for many teens is babysitting , and they can start before 14 if the parents agree. After the children are sleeping and before the parents come home, babysitters have lots of freedom.\nAs long as they stay in the house and make sure the kids are okay, babysitters can do their homework, enjoy a snack, watch TV, or talk on the phone with friends.\nIt can be stressful to balance school, homework, and a part-time job.

If we tell our kids they can't be allowed to surf the Internet, we're cutting them off from their future,\" said an expert.\nMost kids have started to use search engines. Many of them are great for finding tons of interesting Internet sites, and they can also locate places where you might not want your kids to go. There are search engines designed just for kids. A certain software contains only sites that have been selected as safe. The most popular way would be to use what is known as a \"content screener\". But this can't be wholly reliable( ), and the best thing parents can do is to talk to their kids and let them know what is OK or not OK to see or do on the Internet. Another way is that mum or dad is nearby when the child is surfing the Internet.\nA few other tips:\n--Do not put the PC in a child's room but keep it in an area where mum or dad can keep an eye on things. That also makes the Internet more of a family activity.\n--Ask your child what he or she has been doing and about any friends they make on-line.\n--Tell your child not to give on-line strangers personal information, especially like address and phone number.\nAnd tell your children never to talk to anyone they meet on-line over the phone, send them anything, accept anything from them or agree to meet with them unless you go along.",

Therefore, most movie channels are automatically removed form the list of TV channels for an entire family. The following are some good ones based on popularity on a global scale.\nDiscovery Channel\nDiscovery and its many channels can be considered as the founding father of informative channels on television. What National Geographic does in a scholastic  manner, Discovery tries to do in an entertaining manner--educating the masses about anything and everything.\nFox Family\nFinding a movie channel that broadcasts pictures suitable for teenagers and kids alike is very difficult unless your service operator offers you Fox family movies. This channel screens most movies before it broadcasts them, ensuring that no movie shows unacceptable material for young eyes.\nNickelodeon\nA channel very similar to Cartoon Network, it mostly shows US programs. However, their shows are sometimes a bit more mature for younger kids and better suited to kids aged 5 and up.\nABC Family\nABC started the ABC family channel in an attempt to introduce family-centered shows and serials to the public in the USA. The need for this channel was felt after ABC observed the lack of proper family type US channels.\nLiving\nIf travelling is a family hobby and better living is the motto then there is no better channel than Living.

Ecologists pointed out that a forest of tall buildings in a city often overburdens public transportation and parking lots.\nSkyscrapers are also consumers and wasters of electric power. In one recent year, the addition of 17 million square feet of skyscrapers office space in New York City raised the peak daily demand for electricity by 120,000 kilowatts--enough to supply the entire city of Albany, prefix = st1 /New York, for a day.\nGlass-walled skyscrapers can be especially wasteful. The heat loss ( or gain) through a wall of half-inch plate glass is more than ten times that through a typical brick wall filled with insulation   board. To lessen the strain on heating and air-conditioning equipment, builders of skyscrapers have begun to use double-glazed panels of glass, and reflective glasses coated with silver or gold mirror films that reduce glare  as well as heat gain.\nHowever, mirror-walled skyscrapers raise the temperature of the surrounding air and affect neighboring buildings.                \nSkyscrapers put a strain on a city's sanitation facilities ,too. If fully occupied, the two World Trade Center towers in New York City would alone produce 2.25 million gallons of wastes each year-as much a city the size of Stanford,Connecticut, which has a population of more than 109,000.\nSkyscrapers also affect television reception, block bird flyways and air traffic, In Boston in the late 1960's, some people even feared that shadows from skyscrapers would kill the grass on Boston Common. Still ,people continue to build skyscrapers for all the reasons that they have always built them-personal pride and the desire of owners to have the largest possible amount of space to rent.",

Others are not comfortable with any stress at alls they soon become unhappy if they feel stressed. Sometimes stress can lead people to do things they wouldn't usually do, such as overeat, smoke, drink, or use drugs. Streas, however, is a very normal part of life.\nIt is important to understand that stress doesn't come from an event itself, that is, from the things that are happening in our lives. It comes from the meaning we give to what has happened. For example, a crying baby may be stressful to one person, but it may not bother another person at all, a traffic jam may be stressful to one person while another person may be able to stay calm.\nWe can experience stress any time we feel we don't have control. It can come from a feeling that we can't do anything about a situation. Basically, it is the body's way of showing anxiety or worry.\nStress is not just caused by our mental or emotional condition. It is also influenced by how tired we are, whether we have a balanced diet with enough vitamins and minerals, whether we get enough physical exercise, and whether we can relax.\nThe key point of relieving the stress is that we need to find what is causing the stress in our lives. Once we have found it, we should try to change that part of out lives. If we believe that we can control stress, we can begin to control out lives. Then we can start to use stress in positive way.",

The announcement came as Morrisons posted a 13% increase in underlying pre-tax profits of PS869 million in the year to January 30.\nMorrisons is implementing a growth strategy which is focused on expanding its e-commerce business and moving into the convenience store market. It has earmarked PS3 billion in investment over the next three years. The supermarket floated the idea of launching its own website last year and today is the first firm commitment to realising that goal.\nLast month, the company took its first major step to launching an online operation with the acquisition of internet retailer Kiddicare for PS70 million. The company said this move, along with the 10% \"strategic\" stake in American online grocer FreshDirect announced today, would help it launch its own website in the future. FreshDirect was launched in 2002 and serves 600,000 customers in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The deal will see Morrisons chief executive Dalton Philips join the company's board.\nMorrisons also revealed it would open three convenience stores, around 3,000 sq ft in size, in July under the name M Local. The shops will be located in Morrisons' heartland in the north of England, in neighbourhoods around the M62 motorway. The company said the convenience business was the second-fastest growing part of the market. Rival models include Tesco Metro and Sainsburys Local.",

Fifty is supposed to be my father's age, but now I am stuck with this number and everything it means.\nA few days ago, a friend tried to cheer me up by saying, \" Fifty is what forty used to be.\" He had made an inspirational point, Am I over the hill?People keep telling me that the hill has been moved, and I keep telling them that he high-jump bar has dropped from the six feet I once easily cleared to the four feet that is impossible for me now.\n\" Your are not getting older, you are getting better.\" says Dr. Joyce Brothers.

I am moved to show how aging feels to me physically and mentally. Getting older. of course, is obviously a better change than the one that brings you eulogies . In fact, a poet named Robert Browning considered it the best change of all:\nGrow old along with me!\nThe best is yet to me.\nWhether or not Browning was right, most of my first fifty years have been golden ones, so I will settle for what is ahead being as good as what has gone by. I find myself moving toward what is ahead with a curious blend   of both fighting and accepting my aging, hoping that the philosopher   was right when he said.\" Old is always fifteen years from now.\"",

I write in my one-sentence journal every day. Many people have told me that they find it easier to exercise when they exercise every day. If I try to do something just four days a week, I spend a lot of time arguing with myself: Is today the day, or is it tomorrow, or the next day? Does the week start on Sunday or Monday?\nIf you do something every day, you tend to fall into a routine. Routine has a bad reputation for lacking excitement. It's true that novelty and challenge bring happiness and that people who break their routines, try new things, and go to new places are happier, but I think that some routine activities also bring happiness. The pleasure of doing the same thing, in the same way, every day, shouldn't be overlooked. By repeating, you can find happiness in activities like doing dishes or sweeping the floor as well as in your beloved morning coffee-and-news routines.\nTwo geniuses whom I know of also wrote about the power of doing something every day. Andy Warhol wrote, \"Either once only, or every day. If you do something once it's exciting, and if you do it every day it's exciting. But if you do it, say, twice or just almost every day, it's not good any more.\" Gertrude Stein made a similar point, \"Anything one does every day is important and anywhere one lives is interesting and beautiful.\"\nSo if there's something that you wish you did more regularly, try doing it every day; if you do something every day, take great pleasure in it.",

If people go \"Dutch treat\", or simply \"go Dutch\", it means that they will share the expenses of a social engagement.\nThere are many other \"Dutch\" expressions in English, many of which were invented in Britain in the seventeenth century, when the Dutch and the English were commercial and military rivals. The British used \"Dutch\" to refer to something bad, cheap and shameful. A \"Dutch bargain\" at that time was an uneven, one-sided deal; \"Dutch reckoning\" was an unitemized  account; and \"Dutch widow\" was slang for prostitute. Later centuries brought in \"Dutch courage\", for bravery caused by drink; \"Dutch concert\", for noisy music; \"Dutch nightingale\", meaning a frog; and \"double Dutch\", for incomprehensible language or talk.\nSome of the expressions are still in use today, but some are not. In fact, in American English, some \"Dutch\" expressions have nothing to do with the Dutch, but something with the German. It was probably because of the similar spelling and pronunciation that people made a mistake in distinguishing between \"Dutch\" and \"Deutsch\" (the German word for German), when German immigrants came to America in the 1700s. For instance, \"the Pennsylvania Dutch\" refers to the German descendants, instead of the Dutch descendants, living in Pennsylvania.",

It is essential because we can pay money for whatever we want.Money is recognized as banknotes and coins.\nHowever,many years ago people couldn' t go to the shop and buy what they wanted.They had to get what they wanted through the barter trade .It was really difficult,for the barter often depended on coincidence of wants.For example,the seller of grain has to find a buyer who wants to buy grain and who also could offer something the seller wants to buy.And one more example,if a wheat farmer needs what a fruit farmer produces,a direct exchange is impossible because seasonal fruit would spoil before the grain harvest.The solution is to trade fruit for wheat indirectly through a third intermediate commodity ,such as cattle,salt,shells,wine.However,commodity money had their disadvantages.For example,cattle,fur,precious stones couldn' t be cut into smaller pieces and it was inconvenient to keep and transport them.Thus coins were invented.\nThe earliest known coins in the western world came from Lydia in about 650 B.C.Greek cities,the Great Persian Empire and Roman Empire quickly adopted the new useful technique of metal currency.And by the end of the 6th century,coinages were common throughout the region.However,coins as well as commodity money had many disadvantages.For instance,coins quickly show wear  and they usually have small value,so it' s difficult to count large sums of coins.\nAt first,paper money was used in China in about 650 A.D.After then,it was used in Persia and Japan.In Europe,paper money was firstly produced in the Netherlands in the 16th century and in the USA in the 17th century.Paper money is worthless but symbolic.In other words,paper money is just a note.It has a purchasing power because the government announces it as money and citizens accept it universally.",

And, as you speed along the road, you might also think of ways in which you could improve your bike-- make it safer, more efficient, or more comfortable. In fact, the two-wheeled machines make for some cool science projects.\nThis year's Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF), held last May in Cleveland, featured(had)three bicycle projects from three countries. Like many of the other experiments presented at ISEF, the bike projects showed that some of the most interesting scientific research often begins by taking a closer look at things you care about.\nRenato Angulo Chu had even grander ambitions. The 12th-grader from Lima, Peru, wanted to _ some of his country's economic troubles.\n\"I see a problem in my country,\" Renato said. \"If you go to the forests in Peru, in some places you cannot find electricity. If you go with my bicycle, you can turn on the lights.\"\nRenato, 16, spent 3 years designing his special Multibike. The device looks like a fixed exercise bike. It has wires fixed along the frame and a blender strapped (fastened) to the back. Turning the pedals operates the blender. The same principle can be used to sharpen knives or sweep city streets.\nThe Multibike can work either as a fixed bike or as a bicycle able to travel city streets and country roads. It's made from inexpensive materials, and the user gets exercise while pedaling to operate a machine.\n\"You pedal the bike, and you can mix any drink you want,\" Renato said. More importantly, he added, the same concept could be used to bring light to houses in remote regions of the rainforest.",

Sometimes the newspaper sells 200,000 copies every day. It gets more than one million dollars every year! This is much more than other newspapers.\nHow do they decide what to put in the paper? All the adult editors working on the children's daily agree that the paper should be easy and simple to read. Kids should be able to finish it within 10 minutes.\nThe paper covers school life, animals, and science, which are usually kid's favourite subjects. It also talks about big world problem, like the Iraq   war.\nIn order to make the paper more popular with kids, adult editors invite students from age 10 to 15 to take part in their meetings. They have meetings every Wednesday and Sunday. Adult editors, reporters and kids sit together and decide which topics should come out in the paper and on which page.\nWhich topic should come out on the front page, European Union   or bears in the zoo? Often the kid editors and adult writers disagree. Sometimes, the adult editors have to give up because their little editors won't give in.\nUsually the student editors stay in the newspaper office for three hours at each meeting.

We were living in College Station, Texas and my wife and I were on our way home from Houston, Texas one Sunday morning. We decided to stop at a local gas station to get something to eat since we had enough time.\nWhen we finished, we got back into our car and before I started it, we noticed a homeless man standing in front of the building. His clothes were worn and it looked as if he didn't have any money. It was cold and I was sure he wanted something to drink. However, it was not this that moved  me.\nA dog was also walking up to the front of the building. Being a dog lover, I noticed that the dog was a mother and that she had just had some puppies . She was hungry and weak and I felt so bad for her. I knew if she didn't eat soon, she and her puppies would not live on.\nPeople walking by didn't even notice her. She might not have been as pretty and clean as most, but she still deserved  better. But we still did not do anything, someone else did. The homeless man, who I thought could not afford anything to eat, went back into a store and bought dog food with all the money he had.\nI know that this story isn't as inspirational as most stories, but it plays a great part in our lives. You see, that was Mother's Day weekend. And a lot of people forget that some animals are parents too.",

This kind of shrinking can't be reversed, although people can slow or stop this process. But why does shrinking happen at all?\nBecause of gravity (the force that keeps your feet on the ground) , cushions between the bones in the spine  , get compressed  , which makes a person lose a little height and become shorter.\nAnother reason why some older people shrink is because of osteoporosis  . Osteoporosis occurs when bone is broken down and not enough new bone material is made. Over time, bone is said to be lost because it's not being replaced. Bones become smaller and weaker and can easily break if someone with osteoporosis is injured.\nOlder people--especially women, who generally have smaller and lighter bones to begin with--are more likely to develop osteoporosis. As years go by, a person with osteoporosis can get small breaks in bones that are called compression fractures . These breaks cause collapse of the spine and over time the person with osteoporosis can become hunched over  .\nDid you know that every day you shrink a little, too? You aren't as tall at the end of the day as you are at the beginning. That's because as the day goes on, water in the disks of the spine gets compressed due to gravity, making you just a tiny bit shorter. Don't worry, though. Once you get a good night's rest, your body recovers, and the next morning, you're standing tall again!\nSmoking and drinking alcohol can make this problem worse.

        "passage": "Shakespeare's Sister\nLet us imagine, since facts are so hard to come by, what would have happened had Shakespeare had a wonderfully gifted sister, called Judith.\nShakespeare himself went, very probably -- his mother was an heiress -- to the grammar school, where he may have learnt Latin -- Ovid, Virgil and Horace -- and the elements of grammar and logic. He was, it is well known, a wild boy who poached   rabbits, perhaps shot a deer, and had, rather sooner than he should have done, to marry a woman in the neighborhood, who bore him a child rather quicker than was right. That escapade sent him to seek his fortune in London. He had, it seemed, a taste for the theatre; he began by holding horses at the stage door. Very soon he got work in the theatre, became a successful actor, and lived at the centre of the universe, meeting everybody, knowing everybody, practicing his art on the boards, exercising his wits in the streets, and even getting access to the palace of the queen.\nMeanwhile his extraordinarily gifted sister remained at home. She was as adventurous, as imaginative, as curious to see the world as he was. But she was not sent to school. She had no chance of learning grammar and logic, let alone of reading Horace and Virgil. She picked up a book now and then, one of her brother's perhaps, and read a few pages. But then her parents came in and told her to mend the stockings or mind the stew  and not moon about with books and papers. They would have spoken sharply but kindly, for they were practical people who knew the conditions of life for a woman. Soon, however, before she was out of her teens, she was to be engaged to the son of a neighboring wool stapler . She cried out that marriage was hateful to her, and for that she was severely beaten by her father. Then he ceased to scold her. He begged her instead not to hurt him, not to shame him in this matter of her marriage. He would give her a chain of beads or fine dresses, he said; and there were tears in his eyes. How could she disobey him? How could she break his heart?\nThe force of her own gift alone drove her to it. She made up a small parcel of her belongings, let herself down by a rope one summer's night and took the road to London. She was not seventeen. The birds that sang in the woods were not more musical than she was. She had the quickest fancy, a gift like her brother's, for the tune of words. Like him, she had a taste for the theatre. She stood at the stage door; she wanted to act, she said. Men laughed in her face. The manager -- a fat, loose-lipped man -- howled with laughter. He roared something about puppies dancing and women acting -- no woman, he said, could possibly be an actress. She could get no training in her craft. Could she even seek her dinner in a bar or roam   the streets at midnight? Yet her genius was for fiction and lusted to feed abundantly upon the lives of men and women and the study of their ways. At last -- for she was very young, oddly like Shakespeare the poet in her face, with the same grey eyes and rounded brows -- at last Nick Greene the actor-manager took pity on her; she found herself with child by that gentleman and so -- who shall measure the heat and violence of the poet's heart when caught and confined in a woman's body? -- killed herself one winter's night and lies buried at some cross-roads where the omnibuses   now stop outside the Elephant and Castle.\nThat, more or less, is how the story would run, if a woman in Shakespeare's day had had Shakespeare's genius.",

As we passed each other , I caught the other driver's eye for only a second . I wondered whether he might be thinking , as I was , how dependent we were on each other at that moment . I was relying on him not to fall asleep , not to be put off by a phone conversation, not to cross over into my lane and bring my life to a sudden end . Though we had never spoken a word to each other , he relied on me in just the same way .\nMultiplied a million times over, I believe that is the way the world works . At some level , we all depend upon one another . Sometimes that dependence requires us simply not to do something like crossing over the double yellow line . And sometimes it requires us to act cooperatively , with friends or even with strangers .\nAs technology shrinks our world , the need increases for cooperative action among nations . In 2003, doctors in five nations were quickly organized to identify the SARS virus , which saved thousands of lives . The threat of international terrorism has shown itself to be a similar problem, one requiring coordinated action by police and intelligence forces across the world . We must recognize that our fates   are not ours alone to control .\nIn my own life , I've put great stock in personal responsibility . But , as the years have passed, I've also come to believe that there are moments when one must rely upon the good faith and judgment of others . so , while each of us faces the case of driving alone down a dark road , what we must learn is that the approaching light may not be a threat , but a shared moment of trust .",

        "passage": "No one is sure how the ancient Egyptians built the pyramids near Cairo. But a new study suggests they used a little rock'n'roll. Long-ago builders could have attached wooden poles to the stones and rolled them across the sand, the scientists say.\n\"Technically, I think what they're proposing is possible,\" physicist Daniel Bonn said.\nPeople have long puzzled over how the Egyptians moved such huge rocks. And there's no obvious answer. On average, each of the two million big stones weighed about as much as a large pickup truck. The Egyptians somehow moved the stone blocks to the pyramid site from about one kilometer away.\nThe most popular view is that Egyptian workers slid the blocks along smooth paths. Many scientists suspect wokers first would have put the blocks on sleds . Then they would have dragged them along paths. To make the work easier, workers may have lubricated the paths either with wet clay or with the fat from cattle. Bonn has now tested this idea by building small sleds and dragging heavy objects over sand.\nEvidence from the sand supports this idea. Researchers found small amounts of fat, as well as a large amount of stone and the remains of paths.\nHowever , physicist Joseph West think there might have been a simpler way , who led the new study . West said , \"I was inspired while watching a television program showing how sleds might have helped with pyramid construction . I thought , \"Why don't they just try rolling the things ? \" A square could be turned into a rough sort of wheel by attaching wooden poles to its sides , he realized . That , he notes , should make a block of stone \"a lot easier to roll than a square\".\nSo he tried _ \nHe and his students tied some poles to each of four sides of a 30-kilogram stone block.That action turned the block into somewhat a wheel.Then they placed the block on the ground.\nThey wrapped one end of a rope around the block and pulled.The researchers found they could easily roll the block along different kinds of paths.They calculated that rolling the block required about as much force as moving it along a slippery path.\nWest hasn't tested his idea on larger blocks,but he thinks rolling has clear advantages over sliding.At least,workers wouldn't have needed to carry cattle fat or water to smooth the paths.",

You might be sitting in a cafe and see an old man in the corner drinking coffee or tea, and you walk up with another cup of whatever they are drinking , and say: \" I've bought you a coffee\" and walk away. It's a pleasure to see the look of surprise on their faces. There can be some suspicion, but I think that was mostly in the early days when I didn't know how to do it properly. I would walk up quite nervously like I was doing something wrong and I didn't know when to leave. In the end, I learned through _ . Sometimes it worked, other times it didn't. I discovered that you have to walk up with confidence and humour and not \"get in their faces\". You say: \"This is for you\", then you go. It's hit-and-run kindness.

You've got to do it because you really mean it.\nJoin Me is without geographical boundaries, but there are quite a few members in London, and such stories about things happen on the underground or on the buses.

It only goes to show how much profit the big companies are making. Why don't they stop advertising and reduce the price of their goods? After all, it's the consumer who pays...'\nThe poor old consumer! He'd have to pay a great deal more if advertising didn't create mass markets for products. It is precisely because of the heavy advertising that consumer goods are so cheap. But we get the wrong idea if we think the only purpose of advertising is to sell goods. Another equally important function is to inform. A great deal of the knowledge we have about household goods comes largely from the advertisements we read. Advertisements introduce us to new products or remind us of the existence of ones we already know about. Supposing you wanted to buy a washing machine, it is more than likely you would obtain details regarding performance, price, etc., from an advertisement.\nLots of people pretend that they never read advertisements, but this claim may be seriously doubted. It is hardly possible not to read advertisements these days. And what fun they often are, too! Just think what a railway station or a newspaper would be like without advertisements. Would you enjoy gazing at a blank wall or reading railway byelaws  while waiting for a train? Would you like to read only closely printed columns of news in your daily paper? A cheerful, witty advertisement makes such a difference to a dull wall or a newspaper full of the daily ration  of disasters.\nWe must not forget, either, that advertising makes a positive contribution to our pockets. Newspapers, commercial radio and television companies could not survive without this source of revenue . The fact that we pay so little for our daily paper or can enjoy so many broadcast programs is due entirely to the money spent by advertisers. Just think what a newspaper would cost if we had to pay its full price!\nAnother thing we mustn't forget is the 'small ads.' which are in virtually every newspaper and magazine.  What a tremendously useful service they perform for the community! Just about anything can be accomplished through these columns. For instance, you can find a job, buy or sell a house, announce a birth, marriage or death in what used to be called the 'hatch(giving birth), match and dispatch' column but by far the most fascinating section is the personal or 'agony' column . No other item in a newspaper provides such entertaining reading or offers such a deep insight into human nature. It's the best advertisement for advertising there is!",

        "passage": "In 1905, as part of his Special Theory of Relativity, Albert Einstein published the point that a large amount of energy could be released from a small amount of matter. This was expressed by the equation E = mc2. But bombs were not what Einstein had in mind when he published this equation.\nIn 1929, he publicly declared that if a war broke out he would \"refuse to do war service, direct or indirect....\" His position would change in 1933, as the result of Adolf Hitler's coming into power in Germany.\nEinstein's greatest role in the invention of the atomic bomb was signing a letter to President Franklin Roosevelt urging that the bomb be built because some physicists feared that Germany might be working on an atomic bomb. Among those concerned were physicists Leo Szilard and Eugene Wigner. But they had no influence with those in power. So in July 1939 they explained the problem to someone who did: Albert Einstein. After talking with Einstein, in August 1939 Szilard wrote a letter to President Roosevelt with Einstein's signature on it, which was delivered to Roosevelt in October 1939.\nGermany had invaded Poland the previous month, the time was ripe for action. That October research of a-bomb began but proceeded slowly because the invention of the atomic bomb seemed distant and unlikely. In April 1940 an Einstein letter, ghost-written by Szilard, pressed the researchers on the need for \"greater speed\".\nAs the realization of nuclear weapons grew near, Einstein looked beyond the current war to future problems that such weapons could bring. He wrote to his friend about his fear about the future use of the a-bomb.\nThe atomic bombings of Japan occurred three months after Germany gave in. \nIn November 1954, five months before his death, Einstein summarized his feelings about his role in the creation of the atomic bomb: \"I made one great mistake in my life...when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification---the danger that the Germans would make them?",

They graduated from high school and went to the same college for further studies.\nAfter some days Linda found that her friend was behaving strangely. She would remain quiet, sleep too much and turn wild, very often. At first, Linda thought it was just because of the problems she had met in her studies. However, Lucy became even stranger over time. Finally, Linda couldn't take it any longer and asked Lucy about her strange behavior. Lucy broke into tears and said that she was going around with a boy, who was taking drugs and forcing her to take them, too.\nLinda was shocked by her story. She then advised her friend to leave the boy. She reminded Lucy of her dreams of becoming a successful doctor and encouraged her to set an example for others. She also reminded her of how her parents would feel if they found out what their daughter was up to. Through her efforts, Lucy was finally able to leave the boy and drugs. During this time, her friend always stood by her.\nFinally, the two friends graduated and their friendship grew stronger. They both became successful doctors, but never let each other down by getting into bad habits. They lived happily as close friends.\nFrom the story we can know that true friends are those who encourage you to become the best you can ever be. They believe in you and will never leave you.",

And high technology describes any invention or system that uses the newest ideas or discoveries of science and engineering.\nWhat is high tech? A computer is high tech. So is a communications satellite. A modern manufacturing     system is surely high tech.\nHigh tech became a popular expression in the United States during the early 1980's. Because of improvements in technology, people could buy many new kinds of products in American stores, such as home computers, microwave ovens  , etc. \"State of the art\" is something that is as modern as possible. It is a product that is based on the very latest ways and technology. Something that is \"state of the art\" is the newest possible design or product of a business or industry. A state of the art television set, for example, uses the most modern electronic design and parts. It is the best that one can buy.\n\"State of the art\" is not a new expression. Engineers have used it for years, to describe the best and most modern way of doing something.\nMillions of Americans began to use the expression in the late 1970's. The reason was the computer revolution . Every computer company claimed   that its computers were \"state of the art\".\nComputer technology changes so fast that a state of the art computer today might be old tomorrow. The expression \"state of the art\" has become as common and popular as computers themselves. Now all kinds of products are said to be \"state of the art\".",

Her interest in opals   took her to the New South Wales remote town of Lightning Ridge. There were no luxuries  , but she was closer to nature and had a chance to find black opals and make some money.\nMy mother was beautiful with dark hair and brown eyes, but she was also quiet and shy. Early in the Ridge years, she kept to herself, but later, she started going to the neighbourhood centre to make friends.\nIt was her dream to mine, but her get-rich-quick thinking was unrealistic. She was cheated and she was never very successful. But she kept a sense of humour and a charming smile.\nThen, just as friendships began to blossom, she was diagnosed with cancer and had to return south for treatment. She had the intention of cooking Spanish food as special treat for her Ridge friends, but died too soon. In her honour, my aunt, Marisa, and I fulfilled her desire when we visited the Ridge in March last year.\nPeople who mine the Ridge come from a cross section of society, from lawyers to travels. Looks don't mean much: it can be hard to tell who is millionaire and who is poor. Opals attracted Sebastian and Hanna Deisenberger to Lightning Ridge. They planned a two-year stay, but became permanent residents.\nThen there's Neil Schellnegger, 45, who moved to the area with his parents when he was a child. He lives with his son, Luke. Luke is a shy 19-year-old boy who enjoys helping his dad. They haven't had much luck over the past couple of years, but their passion for opals conquers disappointment. They love the peaceful lifestyle.\nDanny Hatcher, 38, is a second-generation miner and president of the Lightning Ridge Miners' Association. He is an optimistic man, driven by the desire to find the perfect opal. \"It's magic,\" he explains. \"Once you start opal mining you don't want to do anything else... There is always the potential for finding a million dollars. Nothing beats it.\"\nIt's a place where dreams --- spiritual or material --- can be fulfilled; a place, for one last bet in life.",

The rabbits were born at the University of Istanbul as part of the cooperation between scientists from universities in Turkey and Hawaii.\nThe rabbits glow to show that a genetic operation technique can work efficiently. \"The green is not important at all--it's just a marker to show the experiment can be done successfully,\" said University of Hawaii associate professor, Stefan Moisyadi.\nTo produce the glowing effect, researchers injected jellyfish DNA into a mother rabbit's embryos. Then those embryos were put into the mother. Similar experiments have resulted in glowing cockroaches  and cats.\nEventually, the researchers hope the technique can lead to new ways to produce medicines, Moisyadi said.\n\"The final goal is to develop animals that are able to produce beneficial molecules in their milk that can be cheaply extracted , especially in countries that cannot afford big factories that make drugs, which usually cost US$1bn to build. Then they will be able to produce their own protein-based medication in animals,\" Moisyadi said.\nThe rabbits are expected to live as long as non-glowing rabbits, but Moisyadi said he understands people can object to this kind of experimentation involving live animals. \"To the people against, I say: think, what are the benefits and what is the harm?\" Moisyadi said. \"And if the benefits outweigh the harm, let's go with the benefits.\"\nMoisyadi started developing the project in 2006, and researchers are now waiting to see if pregnant sheep produce similar results.",

The old guard is suffering: this week's $67 billion merger   between Dell and EMC, makers of computers and storage devices respectively  , was a marriage forced by the rise of the cloud. Disruptive   newcomers are blooming: if Amazon's cloud-computing unit were a stand-alone public company, it would probably be worth almost as much as Dell and EMC combined.\nThe gains for customers have been equally dramatic. Compared with older IT systems, cloud computing is often much cheaper. It adds tremendous flexibility: firms that need more computing capacity no longer have to spend weeks adding new servers and installing software. In the cloud they can get hold of it in minutes. Their applications can be updated continually, rather than just every few months. Individual users can reach their e-mails, files and photos from any device. And cloud services also tend to be more secure, since providers know better than their customers how to protect their computing systems against hackers.\nBut cloud computing makes one problem worse. In the old IT world, once a firm or a consumer had decided on an operating system or database, it was difficult and costly to switch to another. In the cloud this \"lock-in\" is even worse. Cloud providers go to great lengths to make it easy to upload data. They accumulate huge amounts of complex information, which cannot easily be moved to an alternative provider.\nCloud firms also create a world of interconnected services, software and devices, which is convenient but only for as long as you don't venture   outside their universe. Being locked in to a provider is risky. Firms can start to tighten the screws by increasing prices. If a cloud provider goes bust  , its customers may have trouble getting back their data.\nThese risks have already caused a debate about whether the cloud needs stricter regulation. Some European politicians want to force cloud providers to ensure that data can be moved between them. That is too heavy-handed, because strict rules will inhibit   innovation in what is still a young industry. The history of computing suggests that common standards may well appear naturally in response to customers' demands--just as in personal computers, where it is now much easier to use the same files on different systems.\nIn the meantime, a few commonsense measures can reduce the risk of lock-in. Firms that use more than one cloud provider to host their data are less affected. So are those that keep their most important information in their own data centres. Consumers can take precautions, too. Some services are better than others at enabling users to move data between providers (Google does well on this score). Cloud computing promises its users many benefits, but don't mistake it for some sort of digital heaven.",

At that moment, they thought, \"Young people are interested in pirate, but there is no such a chance for people to get together to share it. Why not have a day when everybody talks like a pirate?\" They decided to make September 19th the date. Since then, Baur and Summers have tried hard to promote Talk Like A Pirate Day. As Baur said, \"We've talked like pirates, and encouraged several of our friends to do so every September 19th.\"\nAt first, this day was only known by a few people. In 2002, Baur and Summers sent a letter about their invented holiday to Dave Barry. This columnist really liked their idea. He promoted the holiday and made it known to more and more people. Now, it has really become an international holiday. On Talk Like A Pirate Day, you need to dress like a pirate. You should wear a big hat or maybe cover one of your eyes. You can pretend to be any kind of pirate that you can find in any story or movie.\nHaving fun and being relaxed are not the only best things about the holiday. Young people share the same interest and childhood dreams that day. That's why it is welcomed by so many people, especially young people.\nUnlike traditional holidays, International Talk Like A Pirate Day is a brand new holiday which is invented by the youth themselves and celebrated by themselves too.

That's the question facing those who deal in the literary artifacts of public figures, as they struggle to work out how to do business in the electronic world where information can be copied and spread out more easily than ever before.\n\"Booksellers, collectors and libraries are already trading in digital objects,\" Joan Winterkorn, a researcher told people. When Emory University Library bought author Slaman Rushdie's archives   in 2006, it received a desktop computer, three laptops, a hard drive and a smart phone along with his paper flies. And the writer John Updike, who died last month, started using computers in the 1980s, Winterkorn pointed out, so his \"papers\" will include a big store of electronic documents.\nSo far, however, digital archives have been traded as just a small part of a larger, mainly paper-based archive. Indeed, no one is quite sure how much the digital documents of a historical figure are worth.\n _ \" said Gabriel Heaton, a literary manuscript specialist, adding that more tangible   digital objects were easier for auctioneers   to price and sell, \"What about a laptop? For example, the one used by J. K. Rowling to write Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in an Edinburgh cafe has real value,\" he said. \"Because she used it.\" Even if the hard drive had been cloned by a library, the artifact would still be valuable.\nGordon Bell, from Microsoft Research, suggested that prices will actually fall to almost nothing. \"Once it's been copied and spread out the value is gone. It's just a piece of memory.\"",

I wanted to slip back a few years, when busyness was the exception and not the rule.\nOne night, after a particularly full day and evening games, our family gathered on the porch for ice cream. Two parents, two teens, and three small boys piled on one old swing and a couple of rocking chairs. We were together, in one place, for a small slice of time.\nThe moon was full. The Mississippi River, flowing past our home, was smooth as glass. I wrapped my own arms around the son who sat on my lap and breathed deeply to _ his little-boy scent --dirt and sweat. My heart was still and content .\nI realized that while crazy is our new normal happiness is as usual.

Ted Schredd and Deanna Kopel cycled around North America to show others a way to help the environment. \"Nobody wants to breathe dirty air--but for the air to change. People have to stop driving cars,\" says Ted, \"If more people start riding bikes, the air will be cleaner.\"\nTed started his trip alone. He had $160 in his pocket and plans to cycle around North America. He left his hometown of Vancouver, and when he arrived in San Diego he got the chance to make some extra money for the rest of his 13, 000 km trip. A cyclist he met asked him to speak at an environment meeting in Texas. Within a few hours, Ted was on a plane to the meeting and a big surprise.\nWhen he met Deanna at the meeting, they talked for six hours straight. It was love at first sight. The next day, he called her to ask if she wanted to finish the trip with him. She said yes, sold everything in her flat, gave her notice at work, and was on the road with Ted three weeks later.\nDeanna found Ted's timetable difficult because he got up early in the morning. Deanna was a nurse and usually worked at night. \"All of a sudden, I was up at six when I wanted to sleep until noon,\" said Deanna.\nAs the couple cycled to Florida and up to Montreal and then back to Vancouver, every day was an adventure. They got free meals in restaurants, and slept in people's yards. When they ran out of money, people gave them extra cash. Sometimes people gave away $50 or $100.\nAnd like all good stories this one has a happy ending. On the way back to Vancouver, they stopped in Edmonton to visit Ted's relatives. During the visit, they got married. People tied ten cans and a \"Just Married\" sign to the back of their bikes.\nThey now want to write a book about their trip. \"We want people to know that you can protect our earth and still have fun,\" Schredd said.",

He was bothered by a large number of requests asking him to offer help that took advantage of his fame. \" I was upset the first several days after the prize announcement, but then I realized the prize is just like a mirror that reflects various attitudes about my winning, and more, reflects the real me,\" Mo said. \"I still consider myself an ordinary citizen who writes. And presenting quality works is my duty and best way of giving back to society. I'm no superstar,\" he emphasized  several times.\nMo believes Chinese literature has achieved much in the past thirty years, and the driving force behind that is not the prize. Writers' creations should not be driven by awards, or criticism, or readers' expectations. Mo said he misunderstood the standards of the academy's selection before he visited Stockholm  to receive the prize in December.\n\"I thought they were judging the authors' personality or political features, then I learned the sole standard of their selection is literature itself, which is also deeply based in the Swedish people's long-established practice of reading a large number of books,\" Mo said.\nDuring the forum, established Chinese and Australian writers discussed subjects as diverse as tradition and modernity, the local and the universe and cultural inclusiveness. And they will also read works to each other and the readers. The writers communication will further promote  Chinese writers to a global audience.\nAustralian Ambassador  to China Frances Adamson agreed. \"It's a milestone  of literary exchanges between the two countries, who are longtime friends,\" Adamson said.",

Some PE classes feature in-line  skating, yoga, and even rock climbing.

Now, 9 million U.S. children and teens are overweight. Obesity   can lead to health problems such as diabetes and heart disease later in life.\n\"Our children and youth are becoming unhealthy and obese,\" says Johnson. \"Skateboarding is a great activity that keeps kids doing physical movement and gives them new skills and interest.\"\nSome schools don't allow skateboarding because they say it is dangerous. Tim, however, argues that regular practice eliminates a great deal of the danger. \"We teach students how to do it and how to do it safely,\" he says.\nSome people say skateboarding teaches life lessons. \"Skateboarding teaches kids to believe that if they stick with  something they will finally succeed.\" says education expert Richard Savor from College in Portland.\nSkateboarding encourages kids not to give up in learning difficult skills. \"It's natural for kids to want to learn and get better at things,\" adds Tim. \"When it comes to skateboarding, they'll try a trick hundreds of times before they succeed.\" The same effort could be made in schoolwork.\nEric Brown agrees that skateboarding requires kids to stop saying a task is too hard for them. \"A baby will attempt to walk 600 to 900 times before he or she is successful,\" says Eric, \"We tell students that they shouldn't say 'I can't do it' unless they've tried 600 to 900 times.",

And this Easter, on top of my regular checklist, I had to buy the ingredient  for a delicious, new recipe I'd discovered: sliced ham and turkey layered with Swiss cheese and cabbage, all wrapped in pastry dough.\nTrouble was that my work schedule had left me no time to shop earlier in the week. I would get up extra early and take care of everything on Saturday morning, I thought, as I drove to the office on Friday. But that morning, Yola, one of my co-workers, asked if my husband Robert and I would help her move the next day. \"I really don't have anybody else to ask,\" she apologized.\n\"Sure,\" I told her, soft touch that I am. Early Saturday morning, Robert, my 15-year-old son Ben, and I drove our truck to her old apartment. Oh, the piles of furniture and boxes! It took us till late afternoon to get her settled in her new place.\nBy the time we returned home, I was exhausted. I don't know how I'm going to go shopping now, let alone cook Easter dinner, I thought. The only ingredient I had at home was the cabbage. On the kitchen counter were two shopping bags of food that Yola had sent home with us -- her thanks for helping her move. She was leaving on a trip the next day, and didn't want the food to go to waste.\nI reached into the first bag and pulled out a package of sliced ham. Well, that's lucky, I thought. Then I pulled out a package of sliced turkey, and another of Swiss cheese. That's strange, I thought. There's no way Yola knew my Easter dinner plans. I reached back into the grocery bag, thinking of the Easter miracle. All of a sudden, the strangest feeling came over me. I lifted it out. It was a box of pastry dough -- the final ingredient I needed for my recipe.",

Terrifying but also attractive, they are as popular in the early 21st century as ever, as the current popularity of Twilight series, and its hero Edward Cullen, show. Vampires first appeared in fiction in the 1700s; in 1895 Irish novelist Bram Stoker published Dracula, introducing the world's most famous vampire.\nBut just what is it about these drinkers of human blood that continues to fascinate us? Speaking to Eric Lewis of the Times and Transcript website, academic Deborah Wells said that vampires are \"culturally adaptive \". \"We create very different vampires to fit different times. Edward Cullen is not the same as Count Dracula,\" she said.\nDifferent as they are, Wells believes vampires are \"the perfect containers into which we can pour our current cultural anxieties\". Bram Stoker's Dracula is powerful, yet old and physically ugly. Stoker's book dealt with fear of the fall of the British Empire, real fears in the day in which it was written.\nAccording to the website Bookpages, today's vampires have all our cultural desires, money, power and sexual attraction. Represented by Cullen, they are noble, handsome young men whom women find irresistible . What's more, vampires challenge traditional ideas about death, science and parental authority . This may be why teenagers are drawn to vampire tales.\n\"In many ways, the vampire story shows up teenage concerns,\" said Wells. \"The emotional intensity   of the relationship with the vampire matches the intensity of how it feels to have your first real love affairs. Your first real love, it really feels like life and death.\"",

Her interest in opals   took her to the New South Wales remote town of Lightning Ridge. There were no luxuries  , but she was closer to nature and had a chance to find black opals and make some money.\nMy mother was beautiful with dark hair and brown eyes, but she was also quiet and shy. Early in the Ridge years, she kept to herself, but later, she started going to the neighbourhood centre to make friends.\nIt was her dream to mine, but her get-rich-quick thinking was unrealistic. She was cheated and she was never very successful. But she kept a sense of humour and a charming smile.\nThen, just as friendships began to blossom, she was diagnosed with cancer and had to return south for treatment. She had the intention of cooking Spanish food as special treat for her Ridge friends, but died too soon. In her honour, my aunt, Marisa, and I fulfilled her desire when we visited the Ridge in March last year.\nPeople who mine the Ridge come from a cross section of society, from lawyers to travels. Looks don't mean much: it can be hard to tell who is millionaire and who is poor. Opals attracted Sebastian and Hanna Deisenberger to Lightning Ridge. They planned a two-year stay, but became permanent residents.\nThen there's Neil Schellnegger, 45, who moved to the area with his parents when he was a child. He lives with his son, Luke. Luke is a shy 19-year-old boy who enjoys helping his dad. They haven't had much luck over the past couple of years, but their passion for opals conquers disappointment. They love the peaceful lifestyle.\nDanny Hatcher, 38, is a second-generation miner and president of the Lightning Ridge Miners' Association. He is an optimistic man, driven by the desire to find the perfect opal. \"It's magic,\" he explains. \"Once you start opal mining you don't want to do anything else... There is always the potential for finding a million dollars. Nothing beats it.\"\nIt's a place where dreams --- spiritual or material --- can be fulfilled; a place, for one last bet in life.",

        "passage": "It has been argued that an infant under three who is cared for outside the home may suffer because of the separation from his parents.The British psychoanalyst John Bowlby believes that separation from the parents during the sensitive \"attachment\" period from birth to three may scar   a child's personality and incline to emotional problems in later life.Some people have drawn the conclusion from Bowlby's work that children should not be sent to day care before the age of three, and many people do believe this.But there are also arguments against such a strong conclusion.\nFirstly, anthropologists   point out that the hidden love between children and parents found in modem societies does not usually exist in traditional societies.For example, we saw earlier that among the Ngonis the father and mother of a child did not raise their infant alone.But traditional societies are so different from modern societies that comparisons based on just one factor are hard to understand.\nSecondly, common sense tells us that day care would not be so widespread today if parents and caretakers found that children had problems with it.But Bowlby's analysis raises the possibility that early day care has delayed effects.The possibility that such care might lead to more mental illness or crime 15 or 20 years later can only be noticed by the use of statistics.Statistical studies of this kind have not yet been carried out, and even if they were, the results would be certain to be complicated and controversial.\nThirdly, in the last decade, there have been a number of careful American studies of children in day care, and they have reported that day care had a neutral of slightly positive effect on children's development.But tests that have had to be used to measure this development are not widely enough accepted to settle the issue.",

        "passage": "Scientists have exactly discovered the set of brain cells involved in making risky decisions, and have been able to control them in rats using targeted light. By changing the activity of the cells they were able to change the behaviour of risk-taking rats to avoid risk, hinting the approach could in future be used to treat people with impulse   control problems.\nRisk-taking is a key part of survival, knowing when to take a chance could pay off--such as moving to a new area to look for food when pickings are slim.\nWhile all animals need an element of risk, the preference towards it varies between individuals. Researchers found this variation, which determines how risk-averse an individual is, is regulated by brain cells in a region of the brain called the nucleus accumbens. This cluster of neurons releases the neurotransmitter dopamine, which regulates the brain's reward and pleasure centres.\nPrevious studies have shown that in patients with Parkinson's disease, taking medication which blocks specific dopamine receptors (DR2)   leads to increased gambling   behaviour and risk taking behaviour. In studies with rats, researchers were able to use a technique called optogenetics  --which uses light sensitive proteins to change the activity of cells--to modify cells with DR2 in the nucleus accumbens.\nRats were trained to choose one of two levers, offering them a choice between a \"safe\" or \"risky\" choice. The safe option resulted in a small, but consistent amount of a sugar water treat. But the risky choice consistently delivered smaller amounts of sugar water, with the occasional large pay off--essentially encouraging the animals to gamble for a bigger prize. Around two-thirds of the animals weren't keen on risk, opting for the safe option, but the remaining third were risk-seekers. Brain scans of the animals showed that those with low levels of DR2 consistently went for the gamble.\nBut using pulses of light to stimulate   the DR2 cells and improve their activity could cause the risk-takers to play it safe and opt for the guaranteed but less rewarding option. Once the light-pulses stopped, the risk-takers returned to their gambling strategy.\nIn the _ , stimulating the same cells had little to no effect.\nProfessor Karl Deisseroth, of Stanford University in California, said: \"Humans and rats have similar brain structures involved.\"And we found a drug known to increase risk preference in people had the same effect on the rats. So every indication is that these findings are relevant to humans. \"Risky behavior has its moments where it' s valuable. As a species, we wouldn't have come as far as we have without it.\"",

Actually, the responsibility of having a job helps teens prioritize their time. Many jobs take only a couple of  hour shifts on weeknights. According to a survey, 86 percent of high school students have an after-school, weekend or summer job and students who work between 10 and 20 hours per week during the school year have statistically higher grades-point averages than those who do not work at all. Those who work in high school are more likely to work in college, and financing their college education is a top reason for undergraduates to look for employment. Instead of considering jobs a barrier, employment should be looked at as real-world education. \nOther people think that work adds too much stress, which may be somewhat true, but regardless of having a job or not, there is always going to be stress. Better to learn how to deal with busy schedules in a controlled environment like high school than to be out on your own and alone, experiencing stress for the first time. I personally would be more concerned for the teenager who has to become independent without having any familiarity with working.\nThe biggest reason teens should be allowed to work is that it is a healthy way of earning money. My dad told me, \"Having a job is a good way to save up for things you are going to need or want to do. You get a lot more out of things if you are financially responsible for them.\" Kids need the freedom to choose how to spend their money.

Your shirt changes from sky blue to deep red. Tiny preprogrammed electronics are rearranged in your shirt to change its color. Looking into the mirror, you find it hard to believe that you are 40.

You decide to listen to your shoes. \"Kitchen, what can I have for breakfast?\" A list of possible foods appear on the counter as kitchen checks its food supplies.\n\"Ready for your trip to space.

But, to everyone's surprise, a few years ago June did come to large inheritance .\nAt first June said very little about the money. As the initial shock disappeared, she became excited, June is a great believer in making lists, so I was surprised to find her writing down all the ways she would spend her new wealth.\nAs time went on, she started revising the list. What had been midway down the list was now at the top. At last, I said to her, \"You know, it isn't necessary to spend all your inheritance at once. Take come time; think about it.\" \"I know, I know,\" she answered with a little bit anger.\nThen one morning June called, \"I've decided how I want to use my new inheritance. I want to see what you think,\" she said. This wasn't something I looked forward to, but we had been friends so long.\nAs we sat, June spread a sheet of paper on the table. To my great surprise, she had written only two words: Charities, and Grandchildren-in that order. Though I had promised to keep quiet, I couldn't keep from asking how she came to this decision.\n\"Well,\" she said, \"I took your advice and thought about it.\" She added, \"Helping others means a lot to me, so I'm hoping this gift will help people in need.\"\nI interrupted, \"But what about this big apartment you most hope to have?\"\n\"At first it was hard, but it doesn't seem as important any more\", she answered with a smile.\nThen June moved her hand, and I could see a few words written in tiny letters at the bottom of the page. After having a look at the small print, I burst into laughter. June had written: AND one new wardrobe.",

        "passage": "Women love shoes! They will sometimes go to look for the perfect pair of shoes to wear only once with the perfect outfit or the fashion of the day. Once worn, these fashionable designer shoes may spend weeks, months, or years in the closet without being worn again until another special occasion comes up. With that said, are expensive designer shoes really worth their cost?\nHistorically, shoes were invented to free feet from sharp rocks, hot sands, and blisters. Shoes were made to be simple and functional, with tough leather soles and straps. As society became more sophisticated  , the role of shoes changed; shoes were made to add status to the wearer.\nShoe designers began to work on the production of fashion shoes for the wealthy; shoes meant more for show than for practical use or simplicity. Good shoemakers became well known and printed symbols on their shoes, so people could recognize the maker of that particular design. Designer shoes were thus born.\nMany women develop serious problems with their feet after wearing these designer shoes during the workday and the medical costs for dealing with these problems can get very high. Some popular makers of designer shoes have been working towards combining comfort and practical use into their shoes, but it has been noted that women still go for style, beauty and uniqueness above everything else.\nSo to answer the question as to whether or not designer shoes are worth the cost, the answer is certainly yes, but be smart and invest in a pair of comfortable, not so stylish shoes for the days when you stay outdoors for hours! They can also be very expensive, but I can surely say that they are worth the cost.",

        "passage": "\"To be or not to be.\" Outside the Bible, these six words are the most famous in all the literature of the world. They were spoken by Hamlet when he was thinking aloud, and they are the most famous words in Shakespeare because Hamlet was speaking not only for himself but also for every thinking man and woman. To be or not to be, to live or not to live, to live richly and abundantly, or to live dully and meanly. A philosopher once wanted to know whether he was alive or not, which is a good question for everyone to put to himself occasionally. He answered it by saying: \"I think, therefore I am.\"\nBut the best definition of existence I ever saw was one written by another philosopher who said: \"To be is to be in relations.\" If this is true, then the more relations a living thing has, the more it is alive. To live abundantly means simply to increase the range and intensity  of our relations. Unfortunately we are so constituted that we get to love our routine. But other than our regular occupation, how much are we alive? If you are interested only in your regular occupation, you are alive only to that extent. So far as other things are concerned --- poetry and prose , music, pictures, sports, unselfish friendships, politics, international affairs ---you are dead.\nOn the contrary, it is true that every time you acquire a new interest --- even more, a new accomplishment  --- you increase your power of life. No one who is deeply interested in different kinds of subjects can remain unhappy. The real _ is the person who has lost interest.\nBacon said that a man dies as often as he loses a friend. But we gain new life by contacts with new friends, and new ideas and thoughts, too. Where your thoughts are, there will be your life too. If your thoughts are limited only to your business, only to your physical welfare, only to your narrow circle of the town in which you live, then you live a narrow restricted(, ) life. But if you are interested in what is going on in China, then you are living in China. If you're interested in the characters of a good novel, then you are living with those highly interesting people. If you listen intently to fine music, you are away from your immediate surroundings and living in a world of passion and imagination.\nTo be or not to be --- to live intensely and richly, or merely to exist, which depends on ourselves. Let us widen and intensify our relations. While we live, let us live!",

And why do we want to act as if they must be true? In an age long before the Internet, a young American at a party found himself seated next to the famous Chinese diplomat Wellington Koo.Completely not knowing what to say to someone from such a different culture, this young man turned and asked, \"Likee soupee?\" After all, he assumed, don't all Chinese speak in broken English? Mr.Koo smiled and nodded.Later when called upon to speak, Wellington Koo delivered a wonderful talk in fluent English, sat down while the applause was still continuing, turned to the young man and whispered, \"Likee speechee?\"\nDo you know why red roses are so popular? Men keep buying them.They assume that all women prefer red roses.But when women are asked what color1 of rose is their favorite, they are more likely to answer that they prefer yellow, white or peach.And when asked what kind of flowers they would prefer to receive, the answer is generally not roses at all.The age-old assumption that most women like red roses best is simply not true.\nWe all make assumptions.They're too often wrong and can easily get us into trouble.So here is what I've learned: when in doubt, check it out.And if I'm not in doubt, I still check it out.We may think we know.But what we know may not be so.So it's best to check it out.",

However, the plant is grown not only for its beautiful flowers, but also for its oil that has a host of health benefits. Sunflower oil prevents diseases, lowers cholesterol levels, keeps the heart healthy, and even prevents certain forms of cancer. Sunflower oil is a kind of \"magic oil\" when it comes to skin care, as it makes your skin soft and smooth, and prevents signs of aging. So, let us know more about its effects on your skin.\n1. It Acts as an Effective Emollient .\nSunflower oil is an effective emollient, which means that it helps the skin retain moisture. Thus, people with dry skin can benefit immensely from the regular use of the oil. Also, it is mild, and provides relief from irritation and inflammation of the skin.\n2. It Offers Sun Protection.\nSunflower oil is a rich source of vitamin E. The high vitamin content prevents the sensitive cells of the skin from being damaged by the ultraviolet (UV) rays of the sun. Also, the beta-carotene (b-) present in sunflower oil helps neutralize  free radicals that are responsible for causing damage to the skin, including sunburn and skin cancers.\n3. It Prevents Earlier Aging.\nVitamin E present in sunflower oil not only protects the skin from sun damage, but also from earlier aging. What's more, regular use of sunflower oil can reduce wrinkles and make one look younger. Also, sunflower oil is rich in antioxidants  that keep the skin fresh.\n4. It Prevents Skin Infections .\nSunflower oil is a rich source of essential fatty acids that protect the skin from bacterial infections. Hence, it gives you a healthy skin.\n5. Additional Effects.\nThere are other ways in which sunflower oil can prove to be a boon for your skin. These are given as follows:\nIt helps reduce dark spots; it helps lighten dark circles; it helps soften rough and dry skin; it can be used to remove make-up; it helps relax tired eyes.",

Because of this, most people think that craft no longer exists.\nOne of the ways these people wrongly support their view is by pointing to 100-year-old homes which are still solid, and arguing that it is the craftsmanship that is responsible for their durability. \"Homes in those days were well-built,\" _ say. No doubt these homes were well-built, but what these people have done is mix up the quality of material used in the house with the quality of the craftsmanship.\nHomes today could be built to last just as long as those old homes if people were willing or able to pay the price. For example, most people can no longer afford solid oak stairways, although they were once fairly common in older homes. Nor can they afford the high labor cost of employing a carpenter to build the stairway. Yet if someone can pay the high cost, there are still plenty of carpenters around able to make those stairways. And not only would these carpenters know how to build them, they would probably do a better job than carpenters of old.\nOne thing the modern carpenter has which enables him to do a better job is much more advanced tools. Such tools as laser beams and powerplanes help them lay out a house better and make more precision cuts on the wood. Also, it is not uncommon say more to find carpenters with college degrees and carpenters with a solid knowledge of mathematics, which would enable them to deal with more difficult house designs.\nThe problem of modern quality, then, really boils down to the problem of material, for the modern carpenter is just as able to produce craftsmanship as the carpenter of fifty years ago, but only if given proper material.",

After l8 hours of operation, and weeks of intensive care, Michael was re-leased from the hospital with rods placed in his back.I asked him what had gone through his mind as the accident took place.\n\"The first thing that went through my mind was the well being of my soon-to-born daughter,\" Michael replied. \"Then, as I lay on the ground, I remembered I had two choices: I could choose to live or I could choose to die. In the operation room, I told the doctors and nurses, 'I'm choosing to live. Operate on me as if I am alive, not dead'.\"\nMichael lived, thanks to the skill of his doctors, but also because of his amazing attitude.",

She also gets $100,000 to help pay for her education projects. The UNHCR Nansen Refugee Award honors extraordinary service to people who have been forced from their homes. Eleanor Roosevelt, Graca Machel and Luciano Pavarotti are some of the other winners of the award.\nAsifi faced many problems in Afghanistan before she fled to Pakistan. Resources were limited and education for women was discouraged. However, in Pakistan, the 49-year-old was able to bring change to her conservative Afghan community. She persuaded parents to send their daughters to school in a tent at the Kot Chandana refugee village. The village was in the Punjab Province of Pakistan.\nSince then, Ms. Asifi has guided more than a thousand refugee girls through their primary education. \"When I began my mission to educate Afghan girls, I could not have imagined that one day it will win me this award. I cannot express my happiness,\" she told VOA.\nMs. Asifi was a teacher in Kabul when she fled with her family in 1992. \"In Afghanistan I was teaching both boys and girls,\" she told VOA. \"When I left Afghanistan and ended up in this refugee village with my family, I was saddened to find out there were no facilities here, particularly for women and girls.\" They made their home in the distant refugee community in Kot Chandana. There she began teaching a small number of students in her tent. She made teaching materials by hand.\nHer tent school has led to the opening of several permanent schools in the village. These schools teach more than one thousand children. Support from the UNHCR, local government, and non-governmental organizations helped make these new schools possible.\nMs. Asifi is a mother of six children. She has worked hard to pay for their education. She spends almost all her income to pay her son's tuition to study engineering at Kabul University.\nBut seeking higher education for her four daughters is difficult. There is not enough money or secondary schools for girls in the village.\nThe Afghan teacher hopes more and more children will receive an education in Afghanistan. She hopes her home country becomes better known for higher levels of education, instead of war. \"I want my goal to be introduced in parts of Afghanistan where conservative traditions and customs still prevent parents from sending their daughters to outdoor schools,\" she said.",

According to the survey made by a famous university in the USA, most people have the experience.\n\"People often lose their concentration when they are bored, of course, but also when they are engaged in challenging tasks,\" says Peter Bregman, the head of the survey. \"They sometimes have a feeling to escape from what's difficult or boring, so they jump out,\" he says. The part of the brain devoted to attention is connected to the brain's emotional center. Any strong emotion --quarrels with colleagues, problems at home --can interrupt our attention. Studies over the last decade have shown that too much work to do at a time can easily lead to distraction.\nRefocusing is hard for many people. Robert Epstein suggests the following, \"Stop and listen to some soft music for a few minutes. Find a good friend or a teacher and say out your matter on your mind. Go for a short walk or take a deep breath, where you breathe in deeply, count to five slowly, hold it and breathe out very slowly.\" This can \"blow out all the tension and the unwanted in your mind to _ your focus.\"\nTake more control by structuring your time and becoming more aware of your behaviors. \"Setting the phone alarm to go off every hour is my way of creating awareness,\" Mr. Bregman says. \"You have to inform yourself that you've lost focus in order to do something about it.\" Starting the day with a to-do list is also important, such as when to eat, when to go to the gym or take a walk. But if it's overly ambitious, you will put yourself in a state of anxiety, which makes it hard for the brain to concentrate. \"Choosing three or four things as your priority for the day allows your brain to settle down and focus,\" he says.",

It is almost impossible to measure how much waste water and industrial waste in our oceans, but we can find out how much oil is poured into them legally and illegally. It is illegal to pour oil into the sea close to the shore, but when a ship is many miles out to sea, there are no such rules. Scientists have different ideas as to the amount of oil putting into the sea, but the lowest figure for oil poured in European waters alone is nearly 200 000 tons every year. Some people say the figure could be ten times as high.\nIt is not only our coasts that suffer from oil pollution. Many shell fish, for example, now have high amounts of poisonous substances . Next time you have shell fish to eat, how can you be sure that they are free from oil pollution? You cannot see the effects and you cannot taste them, either. It is really quite a problem.",

        "passage": "Scientists are using a kind of eye-tracking equipment to learn how babies look at the world. In the lab, children 5 months and older crawl   and walk up, down and over adjustable wooden slopes  , gaps and steps.\nIt may seem like the set for a new reality television show, but there are no prizes, except perhaps for the researchers. They hope to understand what makes one child respond to another, how babies adjust their look to their hands and feet to handle objects, and how these very young children adapt to changes.\nThe findings provided by these eye-trackers suggest that babies may be more capable of understanding and acting on what they see than had been thought. \"Quick looks at their mothers' faces may be all they need to get the information they want. They seem to be surprisingly efficient,\" said John Franchak who studies psychology at New York University.\nAlthough sight might largely seem effortless to us, in reality we actively choose what we look at, making about two to four eye movements every second for some 150,000 motions   daily, said Karen Adolph, also a developmental psychologist at N.Y.U. \"Sight is not passive,\" she said. \"We actively adjust our eye movements to the motions of our hands and bodies.\"\nEye-tracking studies have existed for more than a century, but the instruments involved were typically desk machines. The wearable eye-trackers that Dr. Adolph, Mr. Franchak and their colleagues use are based on equipment developed over the last decade by Positive Science, a New York company, with money from the United States Naval Research Laboratory. They were designed to help scientists. Eye-trackers are currently being used in studies to learn the differences in how amateur and professional geologists   scan landscapes and how people examine signs when looking for exits during emergencies.\nThe researchers also found that during the studies babies looked at their mothers just 16 percent of the time. \"That is lower than expected.\" Dr. Adolph said. A large body of past research has placed importance on children watching the faces of adults as they name objects to learn languages. These findings suggest children may not have to look very long to get the information they need, either from people or objects. This gives a new understanding of how much information they need, or how quickly children might process the information.",

Everyone is astonished to see him but they're also pleased to see him alive.\nTom is the hero of the story,but there are other important characters.Huck is an outsider and everyone is afraid of him.Becky is pretty with fair hair,Joe is Tom's best friend.and Injun Joe is the bad man of the story.\nThe theme of the  story  is about children growing up.It describes how strangers are seen in small towns of America. Finally, it talks about freedom,social rules and how people are  punished for bad behaviour.\nWhy do I think The Adventure of Tom Sawyer is a great book? Mark Twain wrote the story in 1876,but it's still read and loved by people all over the world today. And although it's only a story, Twain wrote it in the everyday English of the southern states of America in  the 19th century,so it sounds very real.

They said that the universe would appear to the human eyes to be a light greenish color1.\nKarl Glazebrook and Ivan Baldry of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, reported their finding in January. They presented the research at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society. They said that finding the color1 of the universe was not part of their more serious scientific research. They did it for fun.\nHowever, earlier this month, the scientists admitted making a mistake. They said their finding was much more color1ful than it should have been. They now say the light from our universe is closer to white. It is more like a milky or creamy white color1.\nTheir study attempted to show what people might see if they could observe the universe from far away. The scientists found the average color1 by combining light from about two-hundred-thousand star systems. Their information came from an observatory in New South Wales, Australia.\nThe scientists gave a number value to the color1s of the different star systems. Then they added the numbers together and found the average measurement. The scientists used this average to identify the color1 of the universe. They said it was a very pretty light green. Many newspapers and television stations reported their finding.\nOther scientists and color1 engineers attempted to reproduce the result. Mark Fairchild of the Rochester Institute discovered a mistake in the computer software program used by the Johns Hopkins scientists.\nWhen the mistake was corrected, the results changed.

Unlike the other disciplines ,philosophy cannot be defined by what you study, because it is actually unlimited. Anything can be the subject matter of philosophy: art, history, law, language, literature, mathematics, medicine, psychology, religion, science, and values. Philosophy is one of the world's oldest subjects of study, and in fact, the other academic disciplines are directly related to philosophy. For this reason you get a Doctorate  of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in biochemistry, or computer science, or psychology.\nTwo broad sub-fields of philosophy are logic and the history of philosophy. Logic is the science of argument and critical thinking. It provides sound methods for distinguishing good from bad reasoning. The history of philosophy involves the study of major philosophers and periods in the development of philosophy.\nOf what use is philosophy? First it is useful in educational advancement. It is necessary for understanding other disciplines.  Only philosophy questions the nature of the concepts used in a discipline, and its relation to other disciplines. And through the study of philosophy, one develops sound methods of research and analysis that can be applied to any field.\nThere are a number of general uses of philosophy. It strengthens one's ability to solve problems, to communicate, to organize ideas and issues, to persuade, and to take what is the most important from a large quantity of data.These general uses are of great benefit in the career field, not necessarily for obtaining one's first job after graduation, but for preparing for positions of responsibility, management and leadership later on. It is very short-sighted after all, to take a course of studies only for the purpose of getting one's first job. The useful skills developed through the study of philosophy have significant long-term benefits in career advancement.

The interviews focused on the participants' psychological and emotional distress   (i.e.whether they were nervous, sad, etc.) and if they had experienced any stressful events that day.\n              The participants were also required to answer questions such as, \"How would you rate your relationship with your mother during the years when you were growing up?\" and \"How much time and attention did your mother give you when you needed it?\" The same questions were asked about fathers.\n              People who reported they had a good mother-child relationship reported three percent less psychological distress compared to those who reported a poor relationship, according to Mallers. Men who reported having a good relationship with their fathers during childhood were more likely to be less emotional when reacting to stressful events in their current daily lives than those who had a poor relationship, according to her findings.\n              Also, the quality of mother and father relationships was significantly associated with how many stressful events the participants faced on a daily basis. In other words, if they had a poor childhood relationship with both parents, they reported more stressful incidents over the eight-day study when compared to those who had a good relationship with their parents.\n              Mallers explained why healthy or unhealthy relationships may have an effect on how people handle stress as adults. \"Perhaps having caring parents equips children with the experiences and skills necessary to more successfully navigate their relationships with other people throughout childhood and into adulthood,\" she said.",

A man who has not had a chance to go swimming for years can still swim as well as ever when he gets back in the water. He can get on a bicycle after many years and still ride away. He can play catch and hit a ball as well as his son. A mother who has not thought about the words for years can teach her daughter the poem that begins \"Twinkle, twinkle, little star\" or remember the story of Cinderella or Goldilocks and the Three Bears.\nOne explanation is the law of overlearning, which can be stated as follows: Once we have learned something, additional learning trials increase the length of time we will remember it.\nIn childhood we usually continue to practice such skills as swimming, bicycle riding, and playing baseball long after we have learned them. We continue to listen to and remind ourselves of words such as \"Twinkle, twinkle, little star\" and childhood tales such as Cinderella and Goldilocks. We not only learn but overlearn.\nThe multiplication tables are an exception to the general rule. that we forget rather quickly the things that we learn in school, because they are another of the things we overlearn in childhood. The law of overlearning explains why cramming  for an examination, though it may result in a passing grade, is not a satisfactory way to learn a college course. By cramming, a student may learn the subject well enough to get by on the examination, but he is likely soon to forget almost everything he learned.

        "passage": "A person named Bernard Jackson today is a free man, but he has many bitter memories. He spent five years in prison after a jury  wrongly convicted (...) him of raping two women. At Jackson's trial, although two witnesses testified that Jackson was with them in another location at the time of the crime, he was convicted  anyway. Why? The jury believed the testimony of the two victims, who positively identified Jackson as the man who had attacked them. The court eventually freed Jackson after the police found the real criminal.\nMany factors influence the accuracy of eyewitness testimony. For instance, witnesses sometimes see photographs of several suspects before they try to identify the person they saw in a group of people. They can become confused by seeing many photographs of similar faces. The number of people in the group, and whether it is a person or a photograph, may also affect a witness's decision. People sometimes have difficulty identifying people of other races. The questions the police ask witnesses also have an effect on them.\nMany people believe that police officers are more reliable than ordinary people. Psychologists decided to test this idea, and they discovered that it is not true. Two psychologists showed a film of crimes to both police officers and civilians. The psychologists found no difference between the police and the civilians in correctly remembering the details of the crimes.\nDespite all the possibilities for inaccuracy, courts cannot omit eyewitness testimony from a trial. American courts depend almost completely on eyewitness testimony to resolve court cases. Sometimes it is the only evidence to a crime, such as rape. Furthermore, eyewitness testimony is often correct. Although people do sometimes make mistakes, and convict innocent people, more importantly, eyewitness testimony has rightly convicted a larger number of guilty people.\nAmerican courts depend on the ability of the twelve jurors, and not the judges, to determine the accuracy of the witness's testimony. It is their responsibility to decide if a certain witness could actually see, hear and remember what happened.",

More than 3,500 people have successfully climbed the 8,844m mountain, and more than a tenth of that number reached the peak just over the past year. As more and more people try to test themselves against Qomolangma, many a time the mount can be very crowded. Climbers have complained about waiting for hours in the bottlenecks  on the way to the peak. If bad weather strikes, climbers can and do die.\nBut the dangerous crowds aren't the only problem on Qomolangma. All those climbers need to bring a lot of _ --much of them ends up being left on the mountain, sometimes even the peak itself. Mount Qomolangma is becoming the world's tallest rubbish dump. Here's mountaineer Mark Jenkins writing in National Geographic about the state of Qomolangma: \"The two standard routes, the Northeast Ridge and the Southeast Ridge, are not only dangerously crowded but also badly polluted.\"\nBut the good news is that some mountaineers are taking it upon themselves to clean up Qomolangma. Mountaineer Paul Thelen and his friend Eberhard Schaaf are part of the annual Eco Everest Expedition, which has been cleaning up rubbish from base camps to the peak since 2008. So far they've collected over 13 tons of garbage.\nSome of that rubbish is even being used for a higher purpose. As part of the Mount Everest 8844 Art Project, a group of 15 artists from Nepal collected 1.5 tons of garbage brought down the mountain by climbers. They've changed the cans and oxygen tanks--in one case, part of the remains of a helicopter--into 74 pieces of art that have already gone on exhibition in Nepal's capital. Part of the profit from sales will go to the Everest Peakeers Association, which has helped collect tons of rubbish off the mountain.",

He worked hard and would stay out until he caught enough to feed the family. Not just enough for our family, but also for his Mom and Dad and the other kids that were still at home.\nDad was a big man, and he was strong from pulling the nets and fighting the sea for his catch. When you got close to him, you smelled the ocean.\nWhen the weather was bad he would drive me to school. He would pull right up in front, and it seemed like everybody would be standing around and watching. Then he would lean over and give me a big kiss on the cheek and tell me to be a good boy. It was so embarrassing for me. Here I was twelve years old, and my Dad would lean over and kiss me good-bye!\nI remembered the day I thought I was too old for a good-bye kiss. When we got to the school and came to a stop, he had his usual big smile. He started to lean toward me, but  _ It was the first time I had ever talked to him that way, and he had this surprised look on his face.\nI said, \"Dad, I'm too old for a good-bye kiss.

Letters to the editor must carry the writer's full name, address and telephone number, although the information is not necessary for publication. This requirement to provide personal particulars is a clear indication that writers are responsible for what they say. When a writer wants his voice heard, he needs to claim ownership of his voice. Responsibility is the name of the game.\n\"People today prefer living together to putting their signatures on a marriage certificate because they refuse to accept responsibility for the relationship,\" said social worker Ken Yip, \"and this is what is causing a lot of family problems.\" When we sign a paper, for example, a business contract or a bank document, the signature is a seal of consent, an agreement to take the matter seriously. Most governments and many organizations will not process written complaints if they do not bear the writer's signature. The absence of a signature, they explain, tells us that the writer cannot be too serious and therefore does not deserve a reply.\nThere are people who wish to remain anonymous  for various reasons. Multi-billionaire Mr. King donates generously to charity several times a year. He gives simply because he wants to help but not for the publicity his donations may bring, and he doesn't want his good deeds to make news. In other cases, people insist on anonymity because they are afraid of the consequences of revealing their identity. Crime witnesses may be willing to assist the police, but most are unwilling to give their names when reporting a crime.\nName or no name? The answer is very personal and lies in how much we want to get involved. We all have a name. It is a matter of responsibility to use it when we make a statement, a claim or an accusation. We all want to honor our own name, and it is only by stamping our expression of an opinion with our name that we honor what we say.",

In fact, something far more threatening was at hand, as the Americans were telling Stalin at Potsdam. \nIn 1939 physicists in the United States had learned of experiments in Germany showing the possibility of atomic power and understood the coming damage of an atomic bomb. On August 2, 1939, Albert Einstein warned President Roosevelt of the danger of Nazi Germany's advances in development of the atomic bomb. Eventually, the U.S. Office of Scientific Research Development was created in June 1941 and given combined responsibility with the War Department in the Manhattan Project to develop a nuclear bomb. After four years of research and development efforts, an atomic device was set off on July 16, 1945, in a desert area at Alamogordo, New Mexico, producing an explosive power equal to that of more than 15,000 tons of TNT. Thus, the atomic bomb was born. Truman, the new U.S. president, believed that this terrible object might be used to defeat Japan in a way less costly of U.S. lives than an ordinary invasion of the Japanese homeland. Japan's unsatisfactory reply to the Allies' Potsdam Declaration decided the matter.\nOn August 6, 1945, an atomic bomb, carried from Tinian Island in the Mariana in a specially equipped B-29 was dropped on Hiroshima, at the southern end of Honshu. The combined heat and explosion destroyed everything in the explosion's immediate neighbourhood , produced fires that burned out almost 4.4 square miles completely, and killed between 70,000 and 80,000 people, in addition to injuring more than 70,000 others. A second bomb dropped on Nagasaki on August 9, killed between 35,000 and 40,000 people, injured a like number and ruined 1.8 square miles.",

Your genes control how fast or how long your hair will grow.Some people have a longer than usual anagen growth period.These people may be able to grow more hair than the average person.\nHowever, others struggle to grow shoulder length hair.These people have a shorter than normal anagen period.\nYour health can also affect hair growth.Poor nutrition can cause some hair follicles to stop growing or cause the hairs that grow to become weak or thin.Problems with hair growth can result from thyroid (^?K JSO problems or other conditions.Health experts say people who experience a sudden increase in hair loss should seek medical advice.",

The cash register   showed her I needed 99 cents, but she couldn't figure out how to count out the coins.\" I understood Mike's concern. What we have done is to create several generations of individuals most of whom have no idea how to reason; how to do simple math; how to do research; or, finally, how to be creative . The reason for this is our overuse of information technology: video games, television, digital watches, calculators, and computers. Information technology feeds us information without requiring us to think about it and let us perform operations without understanding them.    \nIt is time we took a hard look at an educational system that only teaches our children how to push buttons. Our kids can't tell time if the clock has hands. They can use calculators, but cannot add, subtract , divide, or multiply. Video games have taken the place of active, imaginative play. Although most of them are technically educated, they choose not to read. They are so used to television and movies that they cannot use their imagination to stay interested in a book.    \n     Therefore, we must do something to help our children. If we don't, they will never learn how to solve problems. They will never learn even basic reasoning skills and will certainly not develop creativity. Instead of filling classrooms with electronics, let's concentrate on good old-fashioned literacy -- reading books. Students must see how things work and how processes lead to results, and they must also stretch their imagination.",

If so, what does it say about the area and the people who live there?\nMany cities are recognized across the world by their unofficial names. New York is the Big Apple, London is the Big Smoke, and Los Angeles is famously called La La Land.\nA project has been carried out to make a survey on how the nicknames of some places came about. The University of Winchester's Professor Bill Lucas is a patron   of the English Project. He explains that unofficial place names often show what people think about a place.\n\"The name that people create for a place forms a connection with feelings,\" he says.\nBasingstoke is a town in central England. The local nickname, Amazingstoke, shows the love that locals seem to have for the area.\nSwindon, on the other hand, is sometimes called Swindump, showing that some people think it's a dump  . Stanford Le Hope in Essex is called Stanford No Hope by locals. And Padstow in Cornwall is so closely connected with the local famous person Rick Stein that it's become known as Padstein.\nSome people say that the project may have a practical use. Glen Hart, the survey's head of research, says the information could be very helpful to the emergency services, for example. \"By having the most complete set of nicknames we could help the emergency services quickly  _ the right place as soon as possible, for people usually remember the nicknames of some places instead of their official names.

These meetings were usually held at the town hall, which was located in the central square.\nIn the eighteenth-century town meetings, only men who owned property and who were church members actually voted, although everyone present was allowed to express their opinions. Later, all citizens were allowed to vote. Thus the town meeting became truly democratic. Town meetings are still common in New England communities.\nIn recent years the town meeting idea has been widely imitated. There are open sessions of this kind on radio and television.

The idea is that you should see and be seen by others.\nThe prom is not just an American tradition, though most people believe that it started in America. In Canada the event is called a \"formal\". In Britain and Australia the old fashioned word \"dance\" is more and more frequently being referred to as a \"prom\". Most countries have some form of celebration when students finish high school: after all, it means the end of life as a child, and the beginning of life as an adult.\nThe prom is expensive to organize and the tickets can cost students a lot of money. The tradition is that students themselves have to raise the money to pay for it. Selling the students newspapers is one way to raise money; so is taking a part-time job at the weekend.\nAlthough the prom should be the experience of a lifetime, it also worries many students. There is the problem of what to wear, who to take as your partner, who will be voted \"prom queen\", etc. And it is not only students who feel worried.

Scintillation happens because of air movements in the earth's atmosphere  . Light is \"bent  \" when it travels through different parts of the earth's atmosphere. As the air in the earth's atmosphere is moving all the time, the light from the stars looks as if it is moving too.\nThe same thing also happens to things on the ground. On a very hot and shiny day, if you look at the road, the image in the distance is not clear and things move slightly. You can also see the same effect if you drop a rock into water. The rock appears a little unclear under the moving water.\nThis twinkling effect causes a lot of problems for astronomers   since they cannot _ the stars clearly. A telescope   was sent into space so that the air movements in the atmosphere could be avoided  . It took a long time to build the space telescope but finally in 1990, a huge space telescope called the Hubble Space Telescope was successfully sent into space. Since then, astronomers have many important observations that have helped people understand space better.\n,.  (10)",

So is a communications satellite. A modern manufacturing     system is surely high tech.\nHigh tech became a popular expression in the United States during the early 1980's.

A state of the art television set, for example, uses the most modern electronic design and parts. It is the best that one can buy.\n\"State of the art\" is not a new expression. Engineers have used it for years, to describe the best and most modern way of doing something.\nMillions of Americans began to use the expression in the late 1970's. The reason was the computer revolution . Every computer company claimed   that its computers were \"state of the art\".\nComputer technology changes so fast that a state of the art computer today might be old tomorrow.

Help Age International published the index of 96 countries that are home to 790-million people 60 and older. Chief Executive Officer Toby Porter said, \"For too long, older people have been excluded  from international and national development planning. We have a world which is ageing fast. And what the index does is to compare and rank countries from best to worst countries in the world to grow old,\" he said. The Global Age Watch Index rates countries in four categories. \"Health, income, what we call capability - ability to carry on contributing employment. And then the final one about enabling environment - what do older people think about the environment that they live in.\"  \n\"The focus on the report this year is on pensions - on retirement income that older men and women can expect.\" The index reports only one in four older people over 65 in low and middle income countries have any kind of retirement saving. Norway gets the highest ranking in the index. Rounding out the top 10 are Sweden, Switzerland, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Iceland, the United States, Japan and New Zealand. Afghanistan is at the bottom of the list following many years of conflict. There are 10 African countries on the index - all near the bottom. South Africa ranks the highest among them at 80. However, Porter said South Africa is doing some positive things. \"We've seen some very encouraging public statements from some senior politicians in South Africa that they recognize the contribution and the importance of supporting their older population. South Africa is one of the so-called BRICS nations - countries with strong emerging economies. Other members include Brazil, ranked 58 - Russia, ranked 65 - India, 69 and China, 48. Porter said, \"A lot of the impetus  behind China introducing pension provision for all of her older citizens was to provide an motivation for them to start using their purchasing power earlier in their lives in spending money rather than saving it for a pension.\" Help Age International recommended African nations begin providing pensions when people turn 60. However, if countries are poor, they might not be able to institute a pension system to every eligible  person at once. Another factor is Africa's youth population, which is much greater than most parts of the world. Therefore, governments are already hard pressed to provide education and jobs.",

Actually, most people experience nervousness at some time or another.\nIf you are feeling anxious, my advice is to first find the cause or causes. Make a list of those things that are making you nervous and work out which ones you can do something about. Focus all of your efforts on managing the causes that you can control.\nMost people cannot tell the difference between controllable  and uncontrollable causes, so things they can't control become a big reason for nervousness. Dealing with this is very important if people want to keep a healthy mind.\nSimply try to accept the uncontrollable causes of nervousness. You might be worried about the weather on a big day, an accident or an attack on the train, or perhaps just things that other people are doing at work. The results may be very important but there is still no use worrying because you can't control any of these things. Accept that you can't control everything. Once you understand this, it becomes easier not to worry.\nIf a situation, such as swimming, is causing you to be anxious, try to face it as often as possible so that you can get used to it.\nIt can often help to think about yourself doing the thing that makes you nervous--then close your eyes and imagine it going well. Imagine how the flight or job interview is going to happen so that you can get used to it. This will help you understand that the thing you fear most is probably not going to happen.",

You may want to share what you eat with your friends or just post part of your daily life onto the Internet. However, such action may be very annoying  to other diners, or even to chefs and restaurant owners. Currently, more and more people begin to consider \" foodstagramming\" as very silly and a bad manner.\nIn many restaurants, diners complain of being blinded by flasher , snapped without their permission and disturbed by people climbing on to chairs for a better angle. Even chefs and restaurant owners are annoyed at food photography. A Michelin-starred  chef said, \"It's hard to build a memorable evening when flashes are flying every six minutes.\"\nAt the start of 2013, the debate on whether it is OK to take photographs of your food in restaurants seemed to swing   towards a definite \"no.\" According to several chefs in New York City, some restaurants there have started banning customers from taking photos of their food. Policies around the ban of food photography vary from restaurant to restaurant, ranging from restrictions on using a flash to outright  bans. If other restaurants follow such policies, it may signal the death of \" foodstagramming\".\nNevertheless, instead of banning food photography, some restaurants are offering food photography courses. In Spain, the restaurant group Grupo Gourmet has started running a \" Fotografia para foodies\" course to instruct its customers to better take food pictures. The course teaches customers to take photos in a proper way without disturbing other dinners, such as never use a flash.",

        "passage": "In 1955, a man named Raymond Kroc entered a partnership with two brothers named Mcdonald. They operated a popular restaurant in California which sold food that was easy to prepare and serve quickly. Hamburgers, French fries, and cold drinks were the main foods on the limited menu. Kroc opened similar eating places under the same name, \"McDonald's\" and they were a quick success. He later took over the company and today it is one of the most famous and successful \"fast-food\" chains  in America and the world.\nWhy was his idea so successful? Probably the most important reason was that his timing was right. In the 1950s, most married women stayed home to keep house and take care of their children. During the 1960s, the movement for equality  between men and women and an economy  that needed more families to have two money-earners resulted in many women returning to the workplace. This meant that they had less time and energy to do housework, so they depended more on fast-food restaurants.\nSingle parents also have little time to spend in the kitchen. People living alone because of divorce  or a preference for a \"single lifestyle\" also depend on this type of food, since cooking for one is often more trouble than it is worth.\nFast food is not part of the diet of all Americans. Another of the 1960s was called back-to-nature movement. More and more Americans based their diets on natural foods. This preference for natural foods continues to this day. These products can now be found not only in the special health food store but also in many supermarkets.",

It was the first serious one in 40 years of farming side by side, sharing machinery, and trading labor and goods as needed .\nThen the long cooperoration fell apart. It began with a small misunderstanding and it grew into a major difference, and finally it exploded into an exchange of bitter words followed by weeks of silence. \nOne morning there was a knock on John's door. He opened it to find a man with a carpenter's toolbox. \"I'm looking for a few days' work\" he said. \"Perhaps you would have a few small jobs here and there I could help with. Could I help you?\" \n\"Yes,\" said the older brother. \"I do have a job for you. Look across the creek  at that farm. That's my neighbor, in fact, it's my younger brother. Last week there was a meadow  between us and he took his bulldozer  to the river levee  and now there is a creek between us. Well, he may have done this to spite me, but I'll go him one better. I want you to build me a fence -- an 8-foot fence -- so I won't need to see his place or his face any more. Cool him down , anyhow.\" \nThe carpenter said, \"I think I understand the situation. I'll be able to do a job that pleases you.\" \nThe older brother had to go to town, so he helped the carpenter get the materials ready and then he was off for the day. The carpenter worked hard all that day measuring, sawing, nailing, and hammering. \nAbout sunset when the farmer returned, the carpenter had just finished his job. The farmer's eyes opened wide, his jaw dropped. \nThere was no fence there at all. It was a bridge -- a bridge stretching from one side of the creek to the other! A fine piece of work -- and his younger brother, was coming across, his hand spread out .. \n\"You are quite a fellow to build this bridge after all I've said and done.\" \nThe two brothers stood at each end of the bridge, and then they met in the middle, taking each other's hand. They turned to see the carpenter lift his toolbox on his shoulder. \"No, wait! Stay a few days. I've a lot of other projects for you,\" said the older brother. \n\"I'd love to stay on,\" the carpenter said, \"but, I have many more bridges to build.\"",

Over a hundred years ago, Charles Dickens shocked many of his readers when he described the conditions under which young children worked in British factories. The conditions Dickens described continue almost unchanged today in many parts of the world. The only difference is that today employment of children is confined(limited)to small industries and family businesses, such as hotels, restaurants and particularly farms, rather than to large factories.\nGirls suffer more from child labor practices than boys. Many of them are forced to start work when they are only ten years old. Although the work they are given to do is often light, it is often harmful to the health. Recently, children as young as six years were found to be working in Asian factories, and the children were working from eight to fourteen hours a day in overcrowded and unhealthy working conditions. Sometimes a whole family group is employed, with the payment going to a parent or older relative. The children not only receive nothing or very little for their long hours of work, but also they are prevented from attending school. Therefore, when they become older they are unable to do any other kind of work.\nThe solution to the problem of child labor is clearly better laws to protect young children, greater supervision of industry and heavier fines for those who break the laws. Only in this way can young boys and girls be allowed to enjoy the most valuable time of their lives--childhood.",

        "passage": "In 1974, after filling out fifty applications, going through four interviews, and winning one offer, I took what I could get ----- a teaching job at what I considered a distant wild area: western New Jersey. My characteristic optimism was alive only when I reminded myself that I would be doing what I had wanted to do since I was fourteen ------- teaching English.\nSchool started, but I felt more and more as if I were in a foreign country. Was this rural area really New Jersey? My students took a week off when hunting season began. I was told they were also frequently absent in late October to help their fathers make hay on the farms. I was a young woman from New York City, who thought that \"Make hay while the sun shines\" just meant to have a good time.\nBut, still, I was teaching English. I worked hard, taking time off only to eat and sleep. And then there was my sixth-grade class ---- seventeen boys and five girls who were only six years younger than me. I had a problem long before I knew it. I was struggling in my work as a young idealistic teacher. I wanted to make literature come alive and to promote a love of the written word. The students wanted to throw spitballs and whisper dirty words in the back of the room.\nIn college I had been taught that a successful educator should ignore bad behavior. So I did, confident that, as the textbook had said, the bad behavior would disappear as I gave my students positive attention. It sounds reasonable, but the text evidently ignored the fact that humans, particularly teenagers, rarely seem reasonable. By the time my boss, who was also my taskmaster, known to be the strictest, most demanding, most quick to fire inexperienced teachers, came into the classroom to observe me, the students exhibited very little good behavior to praise.\nMy boss sat in the back of the room. The boys in the class were making animal noises, hitting each other while the girls filed their nails or read magazines. I just pretended it all wasn't happening, and went on lecturing and tried to ask some inspiring questions. My boss, sitting in the back of the classroom, seemed to be growing bigger and bigger. After twenty minutes he left, silently. Visions of unemployment marched before my eyes.\nI felt mildly victorious that I got through the rest of class without crying, but at my next free period I had to face him. I wondered if he would let me finish out the day. I walked to his office, took a deep breath, and opened the door.\nHe was sitting in his chair, and he looked at me long and hard. I said nothing. All I could think of was that I was not an English teacher; I had been lying to myself, pretending that everything was fine.\nWhen he spoke, he said simply, without accusation, \"You had nothing to say to them.\"\n\"You had nothing to say to them\". he repeated.\" No wonder they are bored. Why not get to the meat of literature and stop talking about symbolism. Talk with them, not at them. And more important, why do you ignore their bad behavior\"? We talked. He named my problems and offered solutions. We role-played. He was the bad student, and I was the forceful, yet, warm teacher.\nAs the year progressed, we spent many hours discussing literature and ideas about human beings and their motivations. He helped me identify my weaknesses and strengths. In short, he made a teacher of me by teaching me the reality of Emerson's words: \"The secret to education lies in respecting the pupil.\"\nFifteen years later I still drive that same winding road to the same school. Thanks to the help I received that difficult first year, the school is my home now.",

Or they might use a computer to help them in their search for a soul mate by joining an online dating service. Some people have even tried to find their perfect match through game shows on television. Many of these TV dating shows, including The Bachelor andWho Wants to Marry Multimillionaire?, have proved to be popular, with millions of viewers watching each week to find out which of the contestants  will find true love.\nOf all these game shows, perhaps the one with the most unexpected ending was Mr. Right, which was shown in England in 2002. On the show, a bachelor, thirty-five-year-old Lance Gerrard-Wright, dated fifteen women to find the one who was his ideal partner. The host of the show was Ulrika Jonsson, an English celebrity   originally from Sweden. For seven weeks on the show, Lance took turns going on dates with each of the women, taking them to expensive restaurants and romantic locations. He even met the women's families and introduced them to his own. Then at the end of each episode , he would choose between one and three of the contestants with whom he had felt the least compatible , and say goodbye to them.\nAt one point during the series, one contestant volunteered to leave because she said she didn't find him attractive. After two dates she said she had had enough, and she couldn't see it working, \"He wasn't my cup of tea.\" In another episode the woman he was on a date with burst into tears when he called her by another girl's name. \"You called me by another girl's name. I can't believe you did that. I really liked you,\" she said in tears.\nBut in the final episode, the woman he eventually chose decided she didn't want to marry him after all. \"I think you've chosen me because you have to choose someone,\" she said. Maybe this was because she already knew he had fallen in love with the show's host!\nAfter leaving the show, Gerrard-Wright and Jonsson were seen dining together and attending parties around London more and more often. Finally, on May 1, 2003, Gerrard-Wright proposed to Jonsson on the steps of St. Paul's Cathedral. And she accepted his proposal right away, although she had to make sure that her two children from previous relationships--an eight-year-old son, Cameron, and a two-year-old daughter, Bo. agreed to the marriage. Luckily, they did. Gerrard-Wright said, \"In the end the show did work for me. I grabbed an opportunity to get a girlfriend and I did. Ulrika's amazing\"\nThe happy couple finally got married at Jonsson's home in Sweden on the island of Varmdo. They wanted to keep the ceremony small, so only forty people were invited, including family and friends. There was some gossip at the time that Jonsson's friends who did not receive invitations to the wedding felt upset. But the bride and groom did not let that ruin their wedding day.\nHas Ulrika Jonsson finally found Mr. Right? Only time will tell. But none of the guests at the wedding could deny the happiness in the couple's eyes as the bride and groom left the wedding ceremony with the music of Stevie Wonder playing in the background, \"Seen a lot of things in this old world. When I touched them, they did nothing, girl. Ooh baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours.\"",

        "passage": "High Speed Book Scanner\nSimply turning pages of a book quickly may not seem like the best way to scan it. A Japanese research group at Tokyo University has created new software that allows hundreds of pages to be scanned within minutes. Scanning text is normally a boring process with each page having to be inserted into a scanner, but the team led by Professor Masatoshi Ishikawa uses a high speed camera that takes 500 pictures a second to scan pages as they are turned by workers.\nNormal scanners can only scan the information that is actually before them on the page. This high speed book scanner uses a camera that captures pages at 1000fps as they are turned. A system built in allows it to automatically correct any changes to the text due to the page bending as well as light differences due to shadows. \"It takes a shot of the shape, then it calculates the shape and uses those calculations to film the scanning,\" Ishikawa said, explaining the system used to reconstruct the original page.\nThe current system is able to scan an average 250-page book in a little over 60 seconds using basic computer hardware. While it now requires extra time to process the scanned images  , the researchers hope to eventually make the technology both faster and much smaller. \"In the more distant future, once it becomes possible to put all of this processing on one chip   and then put that in an iPad or iPod, one could scan just using that chip. At that point, it becomes possible to scan something quickly to save for later reading,\" Ishikawa said.\nBeing able to scan books with an iPhone may be further off, but Ishikawa says that a commercial version of the large-scale computer based scanning system could be available in two or three years.

Some animals have the same code.\"\n     Scientists recently discovered that animals that live in groups, such as elephants, foxes, and wolves, are especially likely to follow rules. If they don't, and each does its own thing, the group might break apart. Group members would be forced to live alone. Then they'd have a harder time hunting and raising their young.\n    That's probably why a traveling wolf pack stopped and waited to let its slowly moving leader catch up. Similar social ties may have caused a captive elephant to save her friend from drowning. Selfish reasons certainly motivated the male fox, who wanted to keep playing.\nSometimes, though, animals go out of their way to do what's right, even when there's nothing in it for them. Nobody knows why. \" It might simply feel good to be kind, just as it does for humans,\"  says Bekoff.\n     If your friend wasn't nice to you, what would you do? Maybe you would just walk away. That's exactly what a wild red fox did when she was play-boxing with another fox. The larger fox, a male, began pushing too hard. The little female didn't like fighting. She ran away quickly.\n     \" He still wanted to play,\" says Marc Bekoff. So the male fox ran after his playmate, bowed down, and rolled over. His body language meant, \" Don't leave, I'll play nicely.\" The female gave him another chance, and the male wrestled more gently this time.",

They've engineered special chickens that lay eggs with disease-treating drugs inside.\nThese eggs come from chickens that have been engineered to produce certain drugs inside their egg whites.\nThese drugs are made of molecules called proteins . Animals make thousands of proteins -- they're the main element in skin, hair, milk and meat. Since animals can make proteins easily, they're good candidates   for making protein drugs.\nResearchers have already made cows, sheep and goats produce protein drugs in their milk. But chickens are cheaper to take care of, need less room, and grow faster than these other animals. Those qualities could make chickens a better choice to become living drug factories, says Simon Lillico of the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh, Scotland.\nLillico and a team of researchers changed chickens' DNA -- the code that tells cells how to make proteins -- so that the birds' cells made two protein drugs. One drug can treat skin cancer, and the other treats a nerve disease called multiple sclerosis  .\nThe scientists changed the chickens' DNA so that the birds made these drugs only in their egg whites. This protects the chickens' bodies from the drugs' possible harmful effects and makes it easy for scientists to collect the drugs.",

This special kind of art can take the form of paintings, sculptures, cloth or even stickers. Street art has become part of a global visual culture. Now, even art museums and galleries are collecting the work of street artists.\nIt is not easy to provide an exact history of the street art movement. This kind of art has developed in many kinds of ways in places all over the world. Also, because it is illegal to paint public and private property without permission, street artists usually work secretly. This secretive nature of street art and its countless forms make it hard to define exactly. And people have different opinions about the movement. Some think street art is a crime and destroys property. But others see this art as a rich form of non-traditional cultural expression.  Many experts say the movement began in New York City in the nineteen sixties. Young adults would use paint in special cans to spray their TAG on walls and train cars around the city. This tag was a name they created to identify themselves and their artwork. This colorful style of writing is also called graffiti. It is visually exciting and energetic.\nGraffiti also became a separate movement expressing the street culture of young people living in big cities. Graffiti art represented social and political rebellion. These artists could travel around areas of the city making creative paintings for everyone to see. Sometimes this street art created a dispute between artists and city officials. Graffiti artists created their images and city officials quickly painted over them. During the 1980s, two famous New York painters--Keith Haring and Jean Michel began showing their work in art galleries and museums. This is when street art started to become part of the more general popular culture.",

Vampires first appeared in fiction in the 1700s; in 1895 Irish novelist Bram Stoker published Dracula, introducing the world's most famous vampire.\nBut just what is it about these drinkers of human blood that continues to fascinate us? Speaking to Eric Lewis of the Times and Transcript website, academic Deborah Wells said that vampires are \"culturally adaptive \". \"We create very different vampires to fit different times. Edward Cullen is not the same as Count Dracula,\" she said.\nDifferent as they are, Wells believes vampires are \"the perfect containers into which we can pour our current cultural anxieties\". Bram Stoker's Dracula is powerful, yet old and physically ugly. Stoker's book dealt with fear of the fall of the British Empire, real fears in the day in which it was written.\nAccording to the website Bookpages, today's vampires have all our cultural desires, money, power and sexual attraction. Represented by Cullen, they are noble, handsome young men whom women find irresistible . What's more, vampires challenge traditional ideas about death, science and parental authority . This may be why teenagers are drawn to vampire tales.\n\"In many ways, the vampire story shows up teenage concerns,\" said Wells. \"The emotional intensity   of the relationship with the vampire matches the intensity of how it feels to have your first real love affairs.

No physical _ took place but Zhai reportedly said something along the lines of \"at worst, I will risk anything on the line.\" The professor called the campus police.\nAccording to the indictment sheet , Zhai is facing the serious charge of making a terroristic threat.\nFor a few days, Chinese media mistranslated, or misunderstood, the charges and reported that Zhai was being charged with terrorism.\nSome language experts have speculated  that the disagreement between Zhai and the professor can also be chalked up to cultural and linguistic differences. \"What Chinese people regard as acceptable speech may be regarded by Americans as threats,\" said Luo Gang, the Chinese Consulate's Overseas Chinese Affairs consul. \"This is an unfortunate incident. Even though Zhai intended no harm, he has done himself a great deal of harm.\"\nDu, now 23, said she supports Zhai's actions in fighting to save his academic career, but added he needs to learn more about communication in a foreign language.\n\"Chinese students in a foreign country must prepare more in terms of languages and conversation skills to avoid misunderstandings,\" she said.",

The freedom to wander  in the city or the wilds as you please is the key to the Iceland experience.\nReykjavik, the capital of Iceland, is just a part of the Icelandic experience with its midnight sun or the magical landscapes mixed with ice and fire. Reykjavik has a population of around 170,000 and offers an interesting mix of culture and local village roots.\nOld accounts say the ancient gods themselves guided Iceland's first settler to make his home in Reykjavik. He named the place Reykjavik (Steamy Bay)after the geothermal steam he saw, which today heats homes and outdoor swimming pools throughout the city, a pollution-free energy source that leaves the air very fresh, clean and clear.\nA beautiful river runs through the city limits, and so do fine parks and even wild outdoor areas. Against this backcloth of nature, Reykjavik has a packed program of familiar city joys too: art museums, several theaters, an opera house, a symphony orchestra and concerts meeting the needs of all ages and tastes.\nOne must for all visitors is dining out on Icelandic specialties, including delicious seafood, ocean-fresh from the morning' s catch, highland lamb and unusual varieties of game. Its purely natural food is imaginatively served to delight the most discerning of diners. Reykjavik is also famous as one of Europe's hottest nightspots, where the action on the friendly pub and nightlife scene lasts right through the night. In the evening, the downtown area is filled with activity, reaching its peak on Friday or Saturday. The number of pubs, cafe, discos, and other nightspots in the downtown area is astonishing. There is a rich variety of places to go: European-style cafes, nightclubs with live entertainment, dance halls for seniors, sports-theme pubs with big TV screens, cafes that offer over 100 types of beer, an Irish pub, a Spanish cafe, a French wine bar.\nWalking distances are short downtown, and everything worth seeing outside the city center can be quickly and conveniently reached by bus. With its long, easy-going main street and large shopping mall, Iceland's capital is a great place to shop too -- with a bonus of tax-free shopping for visitors!\n A full range of accommodations is available in Reykjavik, from international-standard hotels with good conference facilities, through smaller hotels and comfortable guesthouses, to a campsite in the city's biggest park.",

Everyone is astonished to see him but they're also pleased to see him alive.\nTom is the hero of the story,but there are other important characters.Huck is an outsider and everyone is afraid of him.Becky is pretty with fair hair,Joe is Tom's best friend.and Injun Joe is the bad man of the story.\nThe theme of the  story  is about children growing up.It describes how strangers are seen in small towns of America. Finally, it talks about freedom,social rules and how people are  punished for bad behaviour.\nWhy do I think The Adventure of Tom Sawyer is a great book? Mark Twain wrote the story in 1876,but it's still read and loved by people all over the world today. And although it's only a story, Twain wrote it in the everyday English of the southern states of America in  the 19th century,so it sounds very real. Today it's thought to be one of the greatest books in American literature. Go on--- read it! I know you'll enjoy it,too.",

        "passage": "You could feel sorry for Alberto Torres, who is blind. The last thing he remembers seeing was his daughter being born 13 years ago. Then the world went blank; he can only imagine what his only child looks like now, as a teenaged honor student. Bad luck is no stranger to this warm and thoughtful 37-year-old man. His mother died of cancer when he was 4, and his father, who was often ill, had to give him up to the care of the state when he was 11. He later worked for 19 years in a workshop making household goods, deathly boring work. Earlier this month, Alberto Torres's wife, who had just been laid off from her job, had to have a breast removed due to cancer and now faces a year of radiation treatments. Things seemed always to go from almost incredibly bad to worse. Even Mr. Torres's good luck has a dark side: Five years ago, his lovely guide dog pulled him out of the path of a truck. Mr. Torres was not hurt. The dog was killed.\nBut Mr. Torres does not feel sorry for himself. \"These are just little bumps you have to go over in your life,\" he said. At 5 a.m. on a recent morning, we caught up with Mr. Torres at a subway stop in Brooklyn, New York, near where he lives in a third-floor apartment (with no elevator). He had been up since 3 a.m., feeding his new dog, making coffee, getting ready. \"When you're blind, it takes a little longer to do things,\" he said.\nMr. Torres was beginning his two-hour trip to his job developing film in the X-ray department of the emergency room of the Bronx hospital. He would take the G train to Queens Plaza station to the R train, heading towards Manhattan. He would then ride the R train to 59th Street where he would walk upstairs to switch to the Number 6 train. At one point along the journey, he might chat with a stranger. At another, someone would pat his dog, calling him by name. People offered assistance, even seats. At 125th Street, Mr. Torres would transfer to the Number 4 train by crossing the platform. At 149th Street, he would go down to the Number 2. He would take that to East 180th Street where he nearly always has a long wait for his final train, to Pelham Parkway. Then he and his dog would walk 20 minutes to the hospital.\nIt was a hard job to come by. Before he got the job, Mr. Torres was determined to escape the workshop run by an organization dedicated to help people who can't see. He wanted a job developing X-ray film, something that everyone must do in the dark. He had to handle the long trip, as well as the work. \"Our philosophy here is that blind people can do just about anything except drive buses,\" it was the thinking about disabled people at the Bronx hospital. \"We find what a person can do rather than what he can't do,\" said the hospital's director.\nOne day a while ago marked the first anniversary of Mr. Torres's hiring. He developed 150 or so X-rays, his usual output, to celebrate. Mr. Torres works by himself in a small, dark room that smells of chemicals. He cannot wear gloves, because he needs to feel. It is hard work, related to emergency of lives. His immediate supervisor says he trusts him 100%. Mr. Torres makes $20,000 a year. But his motivation goes beyond money. \"If I start feeling like a victim, that makes me bitter. And why be bitter? That makes you go into a hole and stay there.\" he said. \"I'm not doing anything out of the ordinary,\" insisted Mr. Torres as he quickly completed the task.",

She was unable to see her goal.\nTwo months later, she tried again. This time ,despite the same dense fog, she swam with her faith intact and her goal clearly pictured in her mind.

        "passage": "I have only once been in trouble with the law.The whole process of being arrested and taken to court was a rather unpleasant experience at the time, but it makes a good story now. What makes it rather disturbing was the arbitrary circumstances both of my arrest and my subsequent   fate in court.\nIt happened in February about twelve years ago.I had left school a couple of months before that and was not due to go to university until the following October.I was still living at home at the time.\nOne morning I was in Richmond, a suburb of London near where I lived.I was looking for a temporary job so that I could save up some money to go traveling.As it was a fine day and I was in no hurry, I was taking my time, looking in shop windows, strolling in the park, and sometimes just stopping and looking around me.It must have been this obvious aimlessness that led to my downfall.\nIt was about half past eleven when it happened.I was just walking out of the local library, having unsuccessfully sought employment there, when I saw a man walking across the road with the obvious intention of talking to me.I thought he was going to ask me the time.Instead, he said he was a police officer and he was arresting me.At first I thought it was some kind of joke\nBut then another policeman appeared, this time in uniform, and I was left in no doubt.\n'But what for?\" I asked\n'Wandering with intent to commit an arrestable offence,' he said.\n'What offence?' I asked\n'Theft,' he said\n'Theft of what?'I asked\n'Milk bottles,' he said, and with a perfectly straight face too!\n'Oh,' I said.\nIt turned out there had been a lot of petty thefts in the area, particularly that of stealing milk bottles from doorsteps.\nThen I made my big mistake.At the time I was nineteen, had long untidy hair, and regarded myself as pan of the sixties' 'youth counterculture'.As a result, I wanted to appear cool and unconcerned with the incident, so I said, 'How long have you been following me?  in the most casual and conversational tone I could manage.I thus appeared to them to be quite familiar with this sort of situation, and it confirmed them in their belief that I was a thoroughly disreputable   character.\nA few minutes later a police car arrived.\n'Get in the back,' they said.'Put your hands on the back of the front seat and don't move them.'\nThey got in on either side of me.It wasn't funny any more.\nAt the police station they questioned me for several hours.I continued to try to look worldly and familiar with the situation.When they asked me what I had been doing, I told them I'd been looking for a job.'Aha,' I could see them thinking, 'unemployed'.\nEventually, I was officially charged and told to report to Richmond Magistrates' Court the following Monday.Then they let me go.\nI wanted to conduct my own defense in court, but as soon as my father found out what had happened, he hired a very good solicitor  .We went along that Monday armed with all kinds of witnesses, including my English teacher from school as a character witness.But he was never called on to give evidence.My 'trial' didn't get that far.The magistrate   dismissed the case after fifteen minutes.1 was free.The poor police had never stood a chance.The solicitor even succeeded in getting costs awarded against the police.\nAnd so I do not have a criminal record.But what was most shocking at the time was the things my release from the charge so clearly depended on.I had the 'right' accent, respectable middle-class parents in court, reliable witnesses, and I could obviously afford a very good solicitor.Given the obscure nature of the charge.I feel sure that if I had come from a different background, and had really been unemployed, there is every chance that I would have been found guilty.While asking for costs to be awarded, my solicitor's case quite obviously revolved   around the fact that I had a 'brilliant academic record'.\nMeanwhile, just outside the courtroom, one of the policemen who had arrested me was gloomily complaining to my mother that another youngster had been turned against the police. 'You could have been a bit more helpful when we arrested you,' he said to me reproachfully  .\nWhat did he mean? Probably that I should have looked outraged  and said something like, 'Look here, do you know who you're talking to? I am a highly successful student with a brilliant academic record.How dare you arrest me!' Then they, probably, would have apologized perhaps even taken off their caps, and let me on my way.",

Yes, he is Chow Yun-fat.\nThe example of his long hard struggle for success has been used in a chapter in a Hong Kong middle school textbook. Using his experience, students can learn to make the most of their time and to grab every opportunity to succeed.\nOn hearing about this, Chow said happily, \"I really hope that my experiences can make young people understand that one should not be afraid of difficulties and setbacks  , for they are the only way to success.\"\nIndeed, Chow has travelled a long and difficult path to reach his success. In 1955, he was born into a poor family in Hong Kong. When he was 17, he had to leave school. He worked in a number of jobs--as a postman, camera salesman and taxi driver. These experiences paved   the way for him to play all kinds of roles later in life.\nChow broke into the film industry in the late 1970s. He was one of the hardest working actors and starred in a number of popular TV dramas and films including \"Shanghai Bund\"(<<>> ) and \"A Better Tomorrow\". Since 1985, he has won many awards including Taiwan's Golden Horse Awards and Hong Kong Film Awards.\nIn 1995, he went to Hollywood. Although he was already over 40, he had to learn English. _ His film, \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\", began to gain him more fame and recognition around the world. In 1998, the mayor of Chicago set aside January 12 as \"Chow Yun-fat Day\".",

Ulifeline. org), a Web site where students can get answers to questions about depression by logging on through their universities. The site has been adopted as a resource by over 120 colleges, which can customize it with local information, and over 1.3 million students have logged on with their college ID's.\n\"It is a very solid Web site that raises awareness of suicide, de-stigmatizes mental illness and encourages people to seek the help they need,\"said Paul Grayson, the director of counseling services at New York University, which started using the service nearly a year ago.\nThe main component of the Web site is the Self-screening program developed by Duke University Medical Center that tests students to determine whether they are at risk for depression, suicide and disorders like anorexia and drug dependences. Besides helping students, the services compiles anonymous student date, offering administrators an important window onto the mental health of its campus.\nThe site provides university users with links to local mental health services, a catalog of information on prescription drugs and side effects, and access to Go Ask Alice, a vast archive developed by Columbia University with hundreds of responses to anonymously posted inquires from college students worldwide. For students concerned about their friends, there is a section that describes warning signs for suicidal behavior and depression.\nYet it is hard to determine how effective the service is. The anonymity of the online service can even play out as a negative. \"There is no substitute for personal interaction ,\" said Dr. Lanny Berman, executive director of the American Association of Suicidology, based in Washington.\n _ \"The purpose is to find out if there are signs of depression and then direct people to the right places,\" said Ron Gibori, executive director of Ulifeline.\nMrs. Satow, who is still involved with Ulifeline, called it \"a knowledge base\" that might have prevented the death of her son, Jed. \"If Jed's friends had known the signs of depression, they might have seen something,\" she said.",

        "passage": "Woody Guthrie left California for New York in 1940. There he met Alan Lomax, an expert on America's traditional music. He collected and recorded traditional American folk music, which had few fans at that time. When he heard Woody sing, Lomax knew he had found a true singer of American folk music. Lomax recorded many of Woody's songs for the Library of Congress. \n         Three years later, Woody published a book called Bound for Glory. It was about his early life and travels. From this book people came to learn how Woody had spent his unhappy youth. His mother, Nora Guthrie, died of Huntington's Disease   in 1929 when he was only seventeen years old. There was no treatment for the disease. About twenty years later, the disease also began to attack the son. Woody's health got worse and worse, and finally he entered a hospital.    \n         While Woody seemed to be forgotten, his music was not. By the late 1950s, folk music became popular in America. More Americans began listening and playing the songs of Woody Guthrie. Young folk singers came to New York to visit Woody in the hospital. Among them was Bob Dylan, one of America's greatest popular songwriters. He called Woody his hero. Dylan and others copied the way Woody sang and played the guitar. And like Woody, they wrote songs that called for social and political justice  .   \n         Woody Guthrie stayed in the hospital until he died in 1967. In the last years of his life, Woody could hardly speak. But his family and friends knew he still believed in the causes he had sung and written about all his life. They knew this because when they sang his songs, Woody's eyes would become brighter and his defiant   spirit would shine through.",

But looking at the new road, beautiful park and supermarkets, Yang couldn't see any sign that food was once grown there.\nYang is not alone. In recent years, many Chinese people have moved into new houses in country areas. Tall buildings have been built everywhere in the suburbs. The crops and fruit trees are no more. But these changes have caused problems too, warns Gan Zang chun, an official at the Ministry of Land and Resources  .\n\"Chinese cities are growing fast. This has made the area for farmland much smaller. This is really bad for the country's ability to grow food, not to mention the lives of farmers,\" said Gan last Monday.\nThe country needs farmland to grow food for the people of China. But the recent rise in house prices has made selling land a good business. A lot of land has been used to build new houses for sale.\nPollution, which makes land useless, is another reason for the big drop in China's farmland. About 2.67 million square kilometers of land in China have been polluted and turned into desert.\nThe government wants China to have at least 120 million hectares  of farmland. But there are only about 121.8 million hectares left. \"It will be really difficult to reach the goal,\" Gan said.

The Web is filled with all kinds of free services and all it takes is some time and creativity.\n       Think of your home page as the starting point of your website. Like the table of contents of a book or a magazine, the home page is the front door. Your site can have one or more pages, depending on how you design it.\n       While web pages vary greatly in their design and content, most use a traditional magazine layout. At the top of the page is a banner  GRAPHIC. Next comes a greeting and a short description of the site. Pictures, texts, and links to other websites follow.\n       Before you start building your site, do some planning. Think about whom the site is for and what you want to say. Next, gather up the material that you want to put on the site. Draw a rough layout on a sheet of paper.\n       While there are no rules you have to follow, there are a few things to keep in mind:\n       Start simply. If you are too ambitious at the beginning, you may never get the site off the ground. You can always add to your site.\nLess is better. Most people don't like to read a lot of text online.

Say something like, \"You've always been supportive of me, Stephanie, and I'd love you to give me some advice on my professional development.\" This will let your boss know that you're ready for a new challenge. Ask her to give you feedback about how she thinks you can improve as a future leader.\nSecond, ask for your manager's approval   to talk with the training department about any program the company offers. There may or may not be any training, but making the request will still communicate your desire to get into a people-management role.\nThird, you could say to your boss, \"If there is anything you need my help with, I'd love it if you let me know.

People who have such an addiction are compulsive :They have a very powerful psychological need that they feel they must satisfy. According to psychologists, many people are compulsive spenders. They feel that they must spend money. This compulsion, like most others, is impossible to explain reasonably. For compulsive spenders who buy on credit , charge accounts are even more exciting than money. In other words, compulsive spenders feel that with credit, they can do anything. Their pleasure in spending large amounts is actually greater than the pleasure that they get from the things they buy.\nThere is even a special psychology of bargain hunting. To save money, of course, most people look for sales, low prices, and discounts. Compulsive bargain hunters, however, often buy things that they don't need just because they are cheap. They want to believe that they are helping their budgets , but they are really playing an exciting game. When they can buy something for less than other people, they feel that they are winning. Most people, experts claim, have two reasons for their behavior: a good reason for the things that they do and the real reason.\nIt is not only scientists, of course, who understand the psychology of spending habits, but also business people. Stores, companies, and advertisers use psychology to increase business. They consider people's needs for love, power, or influence, their basic values, their beliefs and opinions, and so on in their advertising and sales methods. Psychologists often use a method called \"behavior therapy \" to help individuals solve their personality problems.

The rats were about 75 cm long and.weighed about l.35 kg, light enough to run across a minefield without setting off the mines.\nIn January 2004, the APOPO started this project. First, the trainers let the 4-week-old baby rats get familiar with humans. A few weeks later, the rats were no Ionger afraid of people and 'the things around them. Then they were trained to connect a click* sound with food. After the rats had leamed that, the trainers then taught them to tell the difference between the smell of mines and other smells. When the rats could do it, the click was sounded and they were given a bit of banana.  The method was called clicker training. \"The training isn't easy, said trainer Abdullah Mchomvu.  \"You have to be patient. Sometimes I get angry, but then again, I tell myself these are animals.\"\nAfter nine months'training, the rats were taken to a minefield.

        "passage": "Culture helps human societies survive in changing natural environment.For example, the end of the last Ice Age, beginning about 15,000 years ago, brought a big challenge to which humans had to adapt.Before this time, large parts of the northern hemisphere were covered in great sheets of ice that contained much of the earth' s water.In North America, large animals that wandered the vast tundra   provided people with food and materials for clothing and simple shelters.When the earth became warm, large Ice Age animals disappeared, and many land areas were covered by rising sea levels from melting ice.But people survived, they developed new technologies and learned how to survive on new plant and animal species. Finally some people settled into permanent villages, durable houses and farms.\nCultural adaptation has made humans one of the most successful species on the planet. Through history, major developments in technology, medicine, and nutrition have allowed people to reproduce and survive in ever-increasing numbers.The global population has risen from 8 million during the Ice Age to about 6 billion today.\nHowever, the successes of culture adaptation can also create problems in the long run.Over the last 200 years, people have begun to use large quantities of natural resources and energy and to produce a great amount of material and chemical wastes.The global population now consumes some important natural resources--such as petroleum, wood, and minerals--faster than nature can produce them.Many scientists believe that in the process of burning fuels and producing wastes, people may be changing the global climate in unpredictable and possibly harmful ways.Thus, the adaptive success of the present-day global culture of production and trade may be temporary.",

Your roommate's need to study for an exam may take priority   over pizza. Your instructor may have good reasons not to change your grade.\nIn such a world, persuasion is the art of getting others to give fair and favorable consideration to our points of view. When we persuade, we want to influence how others believe and behave. We may not always _ -- other points of view may be more persuasive, depending on the listener, the situation, and the merit of the case. But when we practice the art of persuasion, we try to ensure that our position receives the attention it deserves.\nSome people, however, object to the very idea of persuasion. They may regard it as an unwelcome interruption into their lives. Just the opposite, we believe that persuasion is unavoidable -- to live is to persuade. Persuasion may be ethical   or unethical, selfless or selfish, inspiring or degrading. Persuaders may enlighten our minds or get our vulnerability . Ethical persuasion, however, calls on sound reasoning and is sensitive to the feelings and needs of listeners. Such persuasion can help us apply the wisdom of the past to the decisions we now must make. Therefore, the most basic part of education is learning to resist the one kind of persuasion and to encourage and practice the other.\nBeyond its personal importance to us, persuasion is necessary to society. The right to persuade and be persuaded is the bedrock of the American political system, guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution  .",

        "passage": "Most Americans receive at least two or three credit card applications in the mail every month.Why have credit cards become so popular? For a merchant, the answer is obvious.By putting charge slips  in a bank, the merchant can change credit card sales into cash.In return for processing the merchant's credit card transactions , the bank charges a fee that ranges between 1.5 and 5 percent.\n         The easiest way to establish credit is to open checking and savings accounts at your local bank.Then apply for a gasoline or store credit card.These cards are fairly easy to get because retailers  want you to buy their goods and services.The third step, and the most dangerous one, is obtaining a major credit card like Visa, MasterCard, or American Express.\n       It is important to choose a credit card carefully because terms and conditions vary widely.Annual fees range from $15 to $75 a year, but some credit card companies charge no annual fee at all.If you will be one of the growing number of people who don't pay off their credit card debts in full each month, look for the card with the lowest interest rate.Interest rates generally range from 12 to 18 percent, though it is possible to find cards with lower rates.\n       A credit card can be your friend because it can get you through unexpected emergencies.And if there is a problem with the products or service you purchase with your credit card, you have an opportunity to hold back payment by asking the credit card company to \"charge back\" to the retailer until the argument is settled.Monthly credit card statements can also help you keep your records in order.Finally, if you make payments on time, the card helps you to establish a good credit history.\n       A credit card can be your enemy because it is an invitation to purchase items you really do not need.The credit card companies' continuous offers of minimum payments, cash advances, and even months without payments may seem like a way to skate through a money crisis.In reality, your finance charges and fees only increase, and you go deeper into debt.\n       If you do find yourself in trouble, do not ignore the bills.Contact your creditors to explain your problem and express your desire to pay down your card balance.If that fails, a nonprofit organization like Consumer Credit Counseling Service can assist you in getting back on your financial feet.",

Yet only seven percent of British shoppers account for nearly 60 percent of organic sales. However popular the idea of organic farming may be, it is still an interest for only a few people.\nSo what makes the idea of organic farming popular? Organic farming means farming with natural materials, rather than with man-made fertilizers or pesticides . Organic farmers rely on many methods -- such as crop rotation   and the use of resistant varieties, because they are necessary for organic farmers to _ the shortage of man-made chemicals.\nOrganic farming is often supposed to be safer than traditional farming for the environment. Yet after a long research on organic farming worldwide for a number of years, science continues to be against this opinion. The House of Commons committee on agriculture stated that, even with complete research work, it would fail to find any scientific evidence to prove \"that any of claims made for organic farming is always true\".\nHowever, the talk about the benefits of organic farming is going on.

For many microblog users, it is a great way of learning the freshest news, talking with friends and sharing different kinds of information, including news, everyday life, pictures, music, videos and so on.\nIt is easy and fast to send a message on a microblog. However, this can also bring problems and even panic  . For example, when the big earthquake and tsunami   hit Japan in March, 2011, messages like \"Salt can help people fight radiation  \" were hot on microblogs. Then a crazy buying of salt followed. Later people knew it was just a rumor  .\nIn a word, microblog plays a new part in the life of Chinese people.",

Time for kids asked for advice from Susan Beacham of Money Savvy Generation, a company that teaches money-management skills to kids.\n\" My first tip is to make a list and check it twice,\" says Beacham. She suggests that kids talk with their families about whom to include in their gift giving and how much to spend. Start by writing down names, Beacham says. Then put a dollar amount next to each name and add it up. Do you have enough money? If not, make changes. And don't forget---- not everyone needs a store-bought gift. Beacham points out that some of the best presents are free. Add to your list the names of people you want to give gifts of time and talent.\nDo the match\nTake the list with you to the store and \"make sure that you do the math,\" says Beacham \" If you've spent $ 30 on someone you were going to spent $25 on, you're going to have to spend $5 less on somebody else.\" The key to budgeting is staying within the boundaries you've set for yourself.\nGifts from the heart\nThe best gifts don't cost a thing. Here are some of Beacham's top gifts ideas.\n*For parents, make coupons  that can be trade for your services, such as doing dishes.\n*For grandma, write a note telling her how special she is to you.\n*For a friend, create a work of art, like a poem, a drawing or a necklace.\n*For teachers, bake a delicious cake.",

Nearly half of 17-year-olds say they read for pleasure no more than one or two times a year. That's way down from ten years ago.\nThe digital revolution   means there are more platforms   than ever to read on. Jim Steyer has been studying the effect of technology on children. He has four kids and has seen the trend most with his 16-year-old. \"I start to see it in our 10-year-old as well, because he is reading less and less, and more and more attracted to some of the digital media platforms that he has access to, and that he didn't have access to when he was 6 or 7 years old,\" he says.\nThe studies don't say that kids are reading less because they're spending more time online. But Steyer is convinced that's at least part of the answer.\n\"First of all, most children now have access to e-readers, or other smart electronic devices like phones and tablets  ,\" he says. \" And they're spending time on that. Many reports show the increasing use of new technology platforms by kids. It just strikes me as extremely logical that that's a big reason.\nResearchers want to know more about how teens are spending their time in the digital age. But Kathryn Zickuhr of the Pew Research Center says it's tricky. If a kid is looking at a book, you may think he or she is reading. But when it comes to looking at a smartphone or tablet, who knows?\n\"We've heard from middle and high school teachers that sometimes the Internet is wonderful for enthusiastic students to do deep research,\" says Zickuhr. \"But on the other side, obviously there are many distractions on the Internet.\"\nHowever, Jim Steyer says, \"Kids with parents who read, who buy or take books out of the library for their kids, and who then set time aside in their kids' daily schedule for reading, tend to read the most -- whether it's on a book, an e-book or some other devices.\"",

        "passage": "Soon after you have your first child, the question of having a second one is raised by friends and family. However, as the pattern of having two children in a family is challenged by modern family units, there are a few reasons why it is not selfish to want only one child. \nToday, the role of women has changed a lot. But nowadays, a wife has to help her husband earn the bread and butter as well as well as looking after her family. In demanding times like these, a woman has to put in more physical and emotional effort than any other member of the family. \nRaising a child comes at a cost that remains only heard of, until you find yourself paying it. The good reality of double income with no kids suddenly comes crashing down when there is a child involved in the picture. When one parent (the mother) needs to take some time off to look after the newborn, only one person becomes the earning member. Of course, the expenses went up rapidly. According to Susan Newman, PhD, a social psychologist, the average cost of raising a child is $227,000 from birth to college.\nMost young mothers also think that having one child would mean that there is more income for the child, and thus, better facilities can be provided. It is much easier to educate a single child at a good school, and give him/her better life with more resources at hand. \nWith several children in the house, it becomes increasingly difficult to find ways to spend time with all of them. Dividing your time with just one child means that you can devote a little more time to doing the things you want to. In a single child unit, there are less comparison and more chances for positive motivation to learn new things. A happy child, who deserves the rightful attention, love, care, and time from both the parents, always gets a meaningful childhood, for both the parents and the child.",

The UK's fourth biggest supermarket said Morrisons.com would offer grocery and non-food products but would take time to build from zero.\nAs part of its online development, Morrisons - the only one of the \"Big Four\" grocers to have a significant internet business - revealed it had invested PS32 million in a 10% stake of a New York-based online grocer. The announcement came as Morrisons posted a 13% increase in underlying pre-tax profits of PS869 million in the year to January 30.\nMorrisons is implementing a growth strategy which is focused on expanding its e-commerce business and moving into the convenience store market. It has earmarked PS3 billion in investment over the next three years. The supermarket floated the idea of launching its own website last year and today is the first firm commitment to realising that goal.\nLast month, the company took its first major step to launching an online operation with the acquisition of internet retailer Kiddicare for PS70 million. The company said this move, along with the 10% \"strategic\" stake in American online grocer FreshDirect announced today, would help it launch its own website in the future. FreshDirect was launched in 2002 and serves 600,000 customers in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The deal will see Morrisons chief executive Dalton Philips join the company's board.\nMorrisons also revealed it would open three convenience stores, around 3,000 sq ft in size, in July under the name M Local. The shops will be located in Morrisons' heartland in the north of England, in neighbourhoods around the M62 motorway. The company said the convenience business was the second-fastest growing part of the market. Rival models include Tesco Metro and Sainsburys Local.",

A microblog differs from a traditional blog in that its content is typically much smaller, in both actual size and aggregate file size.

These may include text messaging, E-mail, or digital audio.\nThe first microblogs were known as tumblelogs. The term was invented in a blog post on April 12, 2005. However, by 2006 and 2007, the term microblog came into greater usage for such services provided by Tumbler and Twitter. Other leading social networking websites Facebook, MySpace, LinkedIn, and XING also have their own microblogging features, better known as status updates.\nSeveral studies, especially by Harvard Business School have tried to analyze the usage behavior of Microblogging services. Many of these studies show that for services such as Twitter, there is a small group of active users contributing to most of the activity.\nTwitter, Facebook and other microblogging services are also becoming a platform for marketing and public relations, with a sharp growth in the number of social media marketers.

        "passage": "\"What is the most important thing you've done in your life?\" The question was put to me during a presentation I gave to a group of lawyers.\nThe answer came to me in an instant. It's not the one I gave, because the situation was not right. As a lawyer in the entertainment industry, I knew the audience wanted to hear some amusing stories about my work with well-known people, but here's the true answer:\nThe most important thing I've ever done occurred on October 8,1990. I began the day playing tennis with an old friend I hadn't seen for a while. Between points we talked about what had been happening in each other's lives. He and his wife had just had a baby boy, who was keeping them up at night.\nWhile we were playing, a car came screaming up the road toward the courts. It was my friend's father, who shouted to my friend that his baby had stopped breathing and was being rushed to the hospital. In a flash my friend was in the car and gone, disappearing in a cloud of dust.\nFor a moment I just stood there, paralyzed . Then I tried to figure out what I should do. Follow my friend to the hospital? There was nothing I could accomplish there, I convinced myself. My friend's son was in the care of doctors and nurses, and nothing I could do or say would affect the outcome. Be there for moral support? Well, maybe. But my friend and his wife both had large families, and I knew they'd be surrounded by relatives who would provide more than enough comfort and support, whatever happened. All I could do at the hospital, I decided, was to get in the way. Also, I had planned a full day with my family, who were waiting for me to get home. So I decided to head back to my house and check in my friend later.\nAs I started my car, I realized that my friend had left his truck and keys at the courts. I now faced another problem. I couldn't leave the keys in the truck. So I decided to go to the hospital and give him the keys.\nWhen I arrived, I was directed to a room where my friend and his wife were waiting. As I had thought, the room was filled with family members silently watching my friend comfort his wife. I went in and stood by the door, trying to decide what to do next. Soon a doctor appeared. He approached my friend and his wife, and in a quiet voice told them that their son had died.\nFor a long time the two held each other and cried, unaware of the rest of us standing around in pained silence. After they had calmed themselves, the doctor suggested they spend a few moments with their son.\nMy friend and his wife stood up and walked past their families. When they reached the door, my friend saw me standing in the corner. He came over and hugged me and started to cry. My friend's wife hugged me, too, and said , \"Thanks for being here.\"\nFor the rest of that morning, I sat in the emergency room of that hospital and watched my friend and his wife hold the body of their infant son, and say goodbye.\nIt's the most important thing I have ever done. The experience taught me two lessons.\nFirst: The most important thing I've ever done happened when I was completely helpless. None of the things I had learned in university, in three years of law school or in six years of legal practice were of any use in that situation. Something terrible was happening to people I cared about, and I was powerless to change the outcome. All I could do was standing by and watching it happen. And yet it was critical that I do just that--- just be there when someone needed me.\nSecond: The most important thing I've done almost didn't happen because of things I had learned in classroom and professional life. Law school taught me how to take a set of facts, break them down and organized them. These skills are critical for lawyers. When people come to us for help, they're often stressed out and depend on a lawyer to think logically. But while learning to think, I almost forget how to feel. Today I have no doubt that I should have leapt into my car without hesitation and followed my friend to the hospital.\nFrom that one experience I learned that the most important thing in life isn't the money you make, the status you attain or the honors you achieve.",

You may want to share what you eat with your friends or just post part of your daily life onto the Internet. However, such action may be very annoying  to other diners, or even to chefs and restaurant owners. Currently, more and more people begin to consider \" foodstagramming\" as very silly and a bad manner.\nIn many restaurants, diners complain of being blinded by flasher , snapped without their permission and disturbed by people climbing on to chairs for a better angle. Even chefs and restaurant owners are annoyed at food photography. A Michelin-starred  chef said, \"It's hard to build a memorable evening when flashes are flying every six minutes.\"\nAt the start of 2013, the debate on whether it is OK to take photographs of your food in restaurants seemed to swing   towards a definite \"no.\" According to several chefs in New York City, some restaurants there have started banning customers from taking photos of their food. Policies around the ban of food photography vary from restaurant to restaurant, ranging from restrictions on using a flash to outright  bans. If other restaurants follow such policies, it may signal the death of \" foodstagramming\".\nNevertheless, instead of banning food photography, some restaurants are offering food photography courses. In Spain, the restaurant group Grupo Gourmet has started running a \" Fotografia para foodies\" course to instruct its customers to better take food pictures.

Subterranean insects issue chemical warning signals through the leaves of the plant. This way, aboveground insects are warned that the plant is already \"occupied\".\n     Aboveground, leaf-eating insects prefer plants that have not yet been occupied by subterranean root-eating insects. Subterranean insects send out chemical signals through the leaves of the plant, which warn the aboveground insects about their presence. This messaging makes it possible for spatially-separated insects to avoid each other, so that they do not compete for, the same plant.\n     In recent years it has been discovered that different types of aboveground insects develop slowly if they feed on plants that also have subterranean insects and 'vice versa  . It seems that a mechanism   has developed through natural selection,  which helps the subterranean and aboveground insects to communicate with each other. This avoids unnecessary competition.\n      Through the \"green telephone lines\", subterranean insects can also communicate with     _ , namely the natural enemy of caterpillars  . Parasitic wasps   lay their eggs inside aboveground insects. The wasps also benefit from the signals sent by the leaves, as these help them find more insects for their eggs.\n     The communication between subterranean and above- ground insects has only been studied in a few systems.

In the mid-2000s he famously coined the phrase \"mindless eating\"(and wrote a book by that name) to focus attention on all the bad dietary decisions we make without really thinking about them.\nHis new book, Slim by Design: Mindless Eating Solutions for Everyday Life, aims to change the design of restaurants, school lunchrooms, office cafeterias and homes so that the mindless choices we make will be more healthful ones. Some examples:\nKeep kitchen counters clear. No visible snack food, no bread, no nuts--not even breakfast cereal. In Wansink's research, \"women who had even one box of breakfast cereal that was visible-anywhere in their kitchen--weighed 21 pounds more than their neighbor who didn't.\"\nTrick yourself into drinking less wine. \"We tend to focus on the height of what we pour and not the width, so we pour 12 percent less wine into taller wineglasses than we pour into wider wineglasses.\" And the shape of the glass is not the only variable that affects how much we drink. Wansink writes: \"Because red wine is easier to see than white wine, we pour 9 percent less red wine whenever we pour a glass.\"\nWansink said his researchers also found that people ate less at restaurants when sat in well-lighted areas near windows and doors, than in darker areas or in the back. They ate less if they were offered a doggie bag, or to-go box, before they got their meals: apparently the idea of getting a \"free\" second meal outweighed the impulse  to clean their plates. Workers who frequently ate at their desks weighed 15.4 pounds less, on average, than those who didn't. Fruits and vegetables kept on the top shelf of the refrigerator were eaten at higher rates than those on lower shelves.\nThe point, Wansink says, is to consider findings like those and change your environment or habits. Then you won't have to think about it: You'll just eat less.",

        "passage": "John Blanchard stood up from the bench, straightened his Army uniform, and studied the crowd of people making their way through Grand Central Station. He looked for the girl whose heart he knew, but whose face he didn't, the girl with the rose.\nHis interest in her had begun thirteen months before in a Florida library. Taking a book off the shelf he found himself intrigued, not with the words of the book, but with the notes penciled in the margin. The soft handwriting reflected a thoughtful soul and insightful mind. In the front of the book, he discovered the previous owner's name, Miss Hollis Maynell. With time and effort he located her address. She lived in New York City. He wrote her a letter introducing himself and inviting her to correspond. The next day he was shipped overseas for service in World War II.\nDuring the next year and one month the two grew to know each other through the mail. Each letter was a seed falling on a fertile heart. A romance was starting Blanchard requested a photograph, but she refused. She felt that if he really cared, it wouldn't matter what she looked like.\nWhen the day finally came for him to return from Europe, they scheduled their first meeting --7:00 PM at the Grand Central Station in New York. \"You'll recognize me,\" she wrote, \"by the red rose I'll be wearing on my lapel.\" So at 7:00 he was in the station looking for a girl whose heart he loved, but whose face he'd never seen.\nI'll let Mr. Blanchard tell you what happened: A young woman was coming toward me, her figure long and slim. Her blonde hair lay back in curls from her delicate ears; her eyes were blue as flowers. Her lips and chin had a gentle firmness, and in her pale green suit she was like springtime come alive. I stared at her, entirely forgetting to notice that she was not wearing a rose. As I moved, a small, attractive smile curved her lips. \"Going my way , sailor?\" she murmured.\nAlmost uncontrollably I made one step closer to her, and then I saw Hollis Maynell. She was standing almost directly behind the girl. A woman well past 40, she had graying hair tucked under a worn hat. She was more than plump, her thick-ankled feet thrust into low-heeled shoes. The girl in the green suit was walking quickly away. I felt as though I was split in two, so keen was my desire to follow her, and yet so deep was my longing for the woman whose spirit had truly companioned me and upheld my own.\nAnd there she stood. Her pale, plump face was gentle and sensible, her gray eyes had a warm and kindly twinkle. I did not hesitate. My fingers gripped the small worn blue leather copy of the book that was to identify me to her.\nThis would not be love, but it would be something precious, something perhaps even better than love, a friendship for which I had been and must ever be grateful. I squared my shoulders and saluted and held out the book to the woman, even though while I spoke I felt choked by the bitterness of my disappointment.  \"I'm Lieutenant John Blanchard, and you must be Miss Maynell. I am so glad you could meet me; may I take you to dinner?\"\nThe woman's face broadened into a tolerant smile. \"I don't know what this is about, son,\" she answered, \"but the young lady in the green suit who just went by, she begged me to wear this rose on my coat. And she said if you were to ask me out to dinner, I should go and tell you that she is waiting for you in the big restaurant across the street. She said it was some kind of test!\"\nIt's not difficult to understand and admire Miss Maynell's wisdom. The true nature of a heart is seen in its response to the unattractive. \"Tell me whom you love,\" Houssaye wrote, \"And I will tell you who you are. \"",

        "passage": "Cutting global warming pollution would not only make the planet healthier, it would make people healthier too, new research suggested.\nCutting carbon dioxide emissions could save millions of lives, mostly by reducing preventable deaths from heart and lung diseases, according to studies released Wednesday and published in a special issue of The Lancet, a British medical journal.\n\"Relying on fossil fuels leads to unhealthy lifestyles, increasing our chances of getting sick and in some cases takes years from our lives,\" US Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a telecast briefing from her home state of Kansas. \"As greenhouse gas emissions go down, so do deaths from cardiovascular  and respiratory  diseases. This is not a small effect.\"\nInstead of looking at the health ills caused by future global warming, as past studies have done, this research looks at the immediate benefits of doing something about the problem, said Linda Birnbaum, director of the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.\nSome possible benefits seemed highly speculative, the researchers conceded, based on people driving less and walking and cycling more. Other proposals studied were more concrete and achievable, such as reducing cook stoves that burn dung , charcoal and other polluting fuels in the developing world.\nAnd cutting carbon dioxide emissions also makes the air cleaner, reducing lung damage for millions of people, doctors said.\n\"Here are ways you can attack major health problems at the same time as dealing with climate change,\" said lead author Dr. Paul Wilkinson, an environmental epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\nWilkinson said the individual studies came up with numbers of premature deaths prevented or extra years of life added for certain places.\nFor example, switching to low-polluting cars in London and Delhi, India, would save 160 lost years of life in London and nearly 1,700 in Delhi for every million residents, one study found. But if people also drove less and walked or biked more, those extra saved years would soar to more than 7,300 years in London and 12,500 years in Delhi because of less heart disease.",

In fact, he was not expected to live through the first winter. But with his mother's care, he managed to survive. As a boy, he caused much trouble for his parents. He used to play jokes on all his friends and neighbors. He didn't like to go to school, and he often ran away from home. He always went in the direction of the nearby Mississippi.

        "passage": "About ten years ago, a young and very successful businessman named Josh was traveling down a Chicago neighborhood street. He was going a bit too fast in his shiny, black, 12 cylinder Jaguar XKE, which was only two months old.\nHe was watching for kids rushing out from between parked cars and slowed down when he thought he saw something. As his car passed, no child came out, but a brick sailed out and - WHUMP!  - it hit the Jaguar's shiny black side door! SCREECH ... ! ! ! ! Immediately Josh stopped the car, jumped out, seized the kid and pushed him up against a parked car. He shouted at the kid, \"What was that all about and who are you? Just what the heck are you doing?!\" \"That's my new Jaguar, that brick you threw is gonna cost you a lot of money. Why did you throw it?\"\n\"Please, mister, please...I'm sorry! I didn't know what else to do!\" begged the youngster. \"I threw the brick because no one else would stop!\" tears were streaming down the boy's face as he pointed around the parked car.  \"It's my brother, mister,\" he said. \"He rolled off the curb   and fell out of his wheelchair and I can't lift him up. \" Sobbing, the boy asked the businessman, \"Would you please help me get him back into his wheelchair? He's hurt and he's too heavy for me. \"\nMoved by the words, the young businessman lifted the young man back into the wheelchair and took out his handkerchief and wiped the scrapers and cuts, checking to see that everything was going to be OK. He then watched the younger brother push him down the sidewalk toward their home.\nIt was a long walk back to the black, shining, 12 cylinder Jaguar XKE -- a long and slow walk. Josh never did fix the side door of his Jaguar. He kept the dent   to remind him not to go through life so fast that someone has to throw a brick at him to get his attention. Feel for the bricks of life coming you.",

        "passage": "Trees are useful to man in three very important ways: they provide him with wood and other products, they give him shade, and they help to prevent drought and floods.\nUnfortunately, in many parts of the world man has not realized that the third of these services is the most important. In his eagerness to draw quick profit from the trees, he has cut them down in large numbers, only to find that without them he has lost the best friends he had.\nTwo thousand years ago a rich and powerful country cut down its trees to build warships, with which to gain itself an empire. It gained the empire but, without its trees, its soil became hard and poor. When the empire fell to pieces, the country found itself faced by floods and starvation.\nEven though a government realizes the importance of a plentiful supply of trees, it is difficult for it to persuade the villager to see this. The villager wants wood to cook his food with, and he can earn money by making charcoal  or selling wood to the townsman . He is usually too lazy or too careless to plant and look after trees. So unless the government has a good system of control, or can educate the people, the forests will slowly disappear.\nThis does not only mean that the villager's sons and grandsons have fewer trees. The results are even more serious. For where there are trees their roots break the soil up--allowing the rain to sink in and also hold the soil, thus preventing it being washed away easily, but where there are no trees, the soil becomes hard and poor. The rain falls on hard ground and flows away on the surface, causing floods and carrying away with it the rich topsoil, in which crops grow so well. When all the topsoil is gone, nothing remains but a worthless desert.",

Tight-fitting trousers will also be forbidden and Muslim head-dresses will have to be \"school blue'' color.\nHead teacher Don Smith said, \"One of the big problems for us at the school has been the number of girls who have been wearing inappropriately short skirts. This has been an area of particular concern at a time when there has been a lot of material nationally about the sexualisation of young people.\"\nHe also said, \" It will be impractical to police the length of girls' skirts. A blanket ban will be easier for staff to put into practice. We did not want to arrive at a situation where we were telling girls their skirts could only be a certain number of centimeters above or below the knee. Pupils', parents' and other teachers' opinions were sought before the uniform rules were changed.,,\nThe new clothing policy has been explained in a letter sent to parents of the school's 1,000 pupils and will come into force after the summer holiday. Support will be given to parents unable to afford the new tie. The school also wants pupils to wear clip-on ties instead of traditional neckties.\nBut the new uniform rules have not been well received by everyone. One parent, whose teenage daughter attends the school, said, \"I completely agree some girls were wearing skirts that were too short. However, I think girls should be allowed to be feminine .Other schools manage to let girls wear skirts while making sure they are not inappropriately dressed.

Yesterday he proudly claimed in court that despite his complete lack of medical experience or qualifications, he had saved several people's lives. He had even been allowed to assist a surgeon during an emergency operation on a patient who was about to die on something she had swallowed.\n\"I watched one of those TV dramas about a hospital and suddenly I felt like playing one of the roles myself. So I put on a white jacket and a stethoscope and walked around one of the biggest hospital in London. At first I just watched. Once you learn how doctors talk to patients, nurses and others doctors, it's easy to take people in,\" he said.\nOne of the patients he treated was Laura Kennan. She had been knocked down by a car and fainted. When she came to in hospital, York was standing over her.\n\"He looked very professional. He told me his name was Doctor Simon. Then he gave me some sort of injection,\" she said. And then he suddenly cleared off when a nurse asked who he was. She didn't think there was anything wrong. \"I would never have realized he was a fake if a policewoman hadn't showed me his photograph a week later. When the policewoman told me who he really was, I could hardly believe my ears.\"\nJudge Raymond Adams told York that he was \" shocked and horrified\" that he got away with his deceiving for so long. And they sentenced him to eighteen months in a special prison for criminal with mental disorders.\n\"I can only hope that this will not lead to further problems. After all, you will have considerable opportunity to study the behaviour of the psychiatrists who will look after you while you are there.

        "passage": "In 1974, after filling out fifty applications, going through four interviews, and winning one offer, I took what I could get ----- a teaching job at what I considered a distant wild area: western New Jersey. My characteristic optimism was alive only when I reminded myself that I would be doing what I had wanted to do since I was fourteen ------- teaching English.\nSchool started, but I felt more and more as if I were in a foreign country. Was this rural area really New Jersey? My students took a week off when hunting season began. I was told they were also frequently absent in late October to help their fathers make hay on the farms. I was a young woman from New York City, who thought that \"Make hay while the sun shines\" just meant to have a good time.\nBut, still, I was teaching English. I worked hard, taking time off only to eat and sleep. And then there was my sixth-grade class ---- seventeen boys and five girls who were only six years younger than me. I had a problem long before I knew it. I was struggling in my work as a young idealistic teacher. I wanted to make literature come alive and to promote a love of the written word. The students wanted to throw spitballs and whisper dirty words in the back of the room.\nIn college I had been taught that a successful educator should ignore bad behavior. So I did, confident that, as the textbook had said, the bad behavior would disappear as I gave my students positive attention. It sounds reasonable, but the text evidently ignored the fact that humans, particularly teenagers, rarely seem reasonable. By the time my boss, who was also my taskmaster, known to be the strictest, most demanding, most quick to fire inexperienced teachers, came into the classroom to observe me, the students exhibited very little good behavior to praise.\nMy boss sat in the back of the room. The boys in the class were making animal noises, hitting each other while the girls filed their nails or read magazines. I just pretended it all wasn't happening, and went on lecturing and tried to ask some inspiring questions. My boss, sitting in the back of the classroom, seemed to be growing bigger and bigger. After twenty minutes he left, silently. Visions of unemployment marched before my eyes.\nI felt mildly victorious that I got through the rest of class without crying, but at my next free period I had to face him. I wondered if he would let me finish out the day. I walked to his office, took a deep breath, and opened the door.\nHe was sitting in his chair, and he looked at me long and hard. I said nothing. All I could think of was that I was not an English teacher; I had been lying to myself, pretending that everything was fine.\nWhen he spoke, he said simply, without accusation, \"You had nothing to say to them.\"\n\"You had nothing to say to them\". he repeated.\" No wonder they are bored. Why not get to the meat of literature and stop talking about symbolism. Talk with them, not at them. And more important, why do you ignore their bad behavior\"? We talked. He named my problems and offered solutions. We role-played. He was the bad student, and I was the forceful, yet, warm teacher.\nAs the year progressed, we spent many hours discussing literature and ideas about human beings and their motivations. He helped me identify my weaknesses and strengths. In short, he made a teacher of me by teaching me the reality of Emerson's words: \"The secret to education lies in respecting the pupil.\"\nFifteen years later I still drive that same winding road to the same school. Thanks to the help I received that difficult first year, the school is my home now.",

Then the world went blank; he can only imagine what his only child looks like now, as a teenaged honor student. Bad luck is no stranger to this warm and thoughtful 37-year-old man. His mother died of cancer when he was 4, and his father, who was often ill, had to give him up to the care of the state when he was 11. He later worked for 19 years in a workshop making household goods, deathly boring work. Earlier this month, Alberto Torres's wife, who had just been laid off from her job, had to have a breast removed due to cancer and now faces a year of radiation treatments. Things seemed always to go from almost incredibly bad to worse. Even Mr. Torres's good luck has a dark side: Five years ago, his lovely guide dog pulled him out of the path of a truck. Mr. Torres was not hurt. The dog was killed.\nBut Mr. Torres does not feel sorry for himself. \"These are just little bumps you have to go over in your life,\" he said. At 5 a.m. on a recent morning, we caught up with Mr. Torres at a subway stop in Brooklyn, New York, near where he lives in a third-floor apartment (with no elevator). He had been up since 3 a.m., feeding his new dog, making coffee, getting ready. \"When you're blind, it takes a little longer to do things,\" he said.\nMr. Torres was beginning his two-hour trip to his job developing film in the X-ray department of the emergency room of the Bronx hospital. He would take the G train to Queens Plaza station to the R train, heading towards Manhattan. He would then ride the R train to 59th Street where he would walk upstairs to switch to the Number 6 train. At one point along the journey, he might chat with a stranger. At another, someone would pat his dog, calling him by name. People offered assistance, even seats. At 125th Street, Mr. Torres would transfer to the Number 4 train by crossing the platform. At 149th Street, he would go down to the Number 2. He would take that to East 180th Street where he nearly always has a long wait for his final train, to Pelham Parkway. Then he and his dog would walk 20 minutes to the hospital.\nIt was a hard job to come by. Before he got the job, Mr. Torres was determined to escape the workshop run by an organization dedicated to help people who can't see. He wanted a job developing X-ray film, something that everyone must do in the dark. He had to handle the long trip, as well as the work. \"Our philosophy here is that blind people can do just about anything except drive buses,\" it was the thinking about disabled people at the Bronx hospital. \"We find what a person can do rather than what he can't do,\" said the hospital's director.\nOne day a while ago marked the first anniversary of Mr. Torres's hiring. He developed 150 or so X-rays, his usual output, to celebrate. Mr. Torres works by himself in a small, dark room that smells of chemicals. He cannot wear gloves, because he needs to feel. It is hard work, related to emergency of lives. His immediate supervisor says he trusts him 100%. Mr. Torres makes $20,000 a year. But his motivation goes beyond money. \"If I start feeling like a victim, that makes me bitter. And why be bitter? That makes you go into a hole and stay there.\" he said. \"I'm not doing anything out of the ordinary,\" insisted Mr. Torres as he quickly completed the task.",

His family later moved to New Haven, Connecticut.\nAt the age of fourteen, he began to play the saxophone and then the clarinet. From a very young age, Artie Shaw wanted to play his clarinet better than anyone. He wanted his sound and music to be perfect. He worked at this task much of his life.\nHe began working as a professional musician when he was fifteen. He left home and began playing in bands across the United States.\nIn 1928, young Artie Shaw traveled to Chicago, Illinois to hear the great trumpet player, Louis Armstrong. He immediately understood that Armstrong's great jazz sound was the beginning of something new and exciting. Artie left Chicago with a growing interest in jazz music. Soon after, he moved to New York City.\nHe got work playing the clarinet for the Columbia Broadcast System radio network. In 1936, he was given a chance to form a small group and play at New York's famous Imperial Theater on Broadway. His group was not the top band in the show. But the crowd loved his music. This proved to be a major step in his career.\nArtie Shaw was always trying something new, something different. He heard a young black woman sing and hired her for his band. This was the first time that a black woman sang with white musicians. Racial separation was the rule in many states. Artie Shaw did not care.\nArtie Shaw wrote several books in his later years. He wrote stories for magazines. He spoke about music at colleges and universities. But he had very little to do with the world of recording or music.

Then Why Not Leather?\nMuch to the displeasure of some local businesses, the City Council in West Hollywood, California, voted without opposition last week to ban the sale of fur products. Should laws be involved in this issue? Is it unfair to ban sales of fur, but not sales of leather and hides  ?\nAnimals Do Not Have Rights\nBy Tibor R. Machan\nMy view is that animals do not have basic rights. It is a matter of ethics   and not of the laws of human societies. If animals had such rights as human beings do, they would have to be held responsible for killing fellow animals in the wild. That way of thinking about animals makes a category mistake. Using animals, including their fur or organs, to improve people's lives is acceptable.\nA Small Step Against Cruelty\nBy Kate Carter\nBoth fur and leather are the skins of dead animals. Why should we think that the lovable furry ones deserve more of a life than the less pleasing ones? Some say leather is  less cruel because it's a byproduct   of the meat industry. But this isn't really true. Some cheap leather may be a byproduct of the meat industry, but often it's the other way round. In South Africa, where there is a developing market for ostrich farms, the skins account for roughly 80 percent of the slaughtered  birds' value, a mere 20 percent of which comes from the meat.\n\"Who\" Are You Wearing?\nBy Marc Bekoff\nWest Hollywood's ban is a move in the right direction. However, we must work to ban the sales of leather and hides, too. Furs come from animals who are attacked to become clothing, while some leather and hides come from slaughterhouse  animals. We must remember that when people choose to wear fur, leather and hides, they are wearing formering conscious beings. So it's a matter of who they are wearing, not what they are wearing because these animals must be referred to as who and not what or that.",

In fact, they were shot from 1914 through 1916, most of them after a disastrous shipwreck , by a cameraman who had no reasonable expectation of survival. Many of the images were stored in an ice chest, under freezing water, in the damaged wooden ship.\nThe ship was the Endurance, a small, tight, Norwegian-built three-master that was intended to take Sir Ernest Shackleton and a small crew of seamen and scientists, 27 men in all, to the southernmost shore of Antarctica's Weddell Sea. From that point Shackleton wanted to force a passage by dog sled  across the continent. The journey was intended to achieve more than what Captain Robert Falcon Scott had done. Captain Scott had reached the South Pole early in 1912 but had died with his four companions on the march back.\nAs writer Caroline Alexander makes clear in her forceful and well-researched story The Endurance, adventuring was even then a thoroughly commercial effort. Scott's last journey, completed as be lay in a tent dying of cold and hunger, caught the world's imagination, and a film made in his honor drew crowds. Shackleton, a onetime British merchant-navy officer who had got to within 100 miles of the South Pole in 1908, started a business before his 1914 voyage to make money from movie and still photography.

However, students in a British grammar school really enjoy running on the corridor tiles   and their teachers even encourage them to do that.\nWhy? It is because the corridor was built with special kinetic   tiles. When students jump on the tiles, electricity will be produced. After one year, the electricity produced from the tiles can fully charge 853 mobile phones or power  an electric car to drive seven miles. It's amazing, isn't it?\nThe corridor tiles are really a brilliant invention. Students can not only play on the corridor, but also help power the lights in their school corridors and other equipment in their classrooms. Besides, this is a good way to teach students to be creative. They will be _ to be scientists, inventors and engineers in the future to find clean energy for all humans.\nThe inventor of the magic corridor tiles is Laurence Kemball-Cook. He was once a student in this school. Now, he is CEO of his own company. The corridor tiles are not Laurence's only invention. He has also invented a special dance floor, which can be used at music festivals. It allows dancers to charge their mobile phones while they are dancing on the dance floor.",

They have only a limited social life because of their disability. Giving some of them guide dogs at a younger age is intended to help them to widen their range of activities and to improve their sense of self-confidence and independence. Guide dogs for these teenagers will begin to be provided from next year. There has been an experimental project to test the use of guide dogs with younger people.\nCharlotte, aged 14, was among the youngest guide dog owners. She had been gradually losing her eyesight since the age of eight, and lost her eyesight completely this year. She has been assisted by a two-year-old guide dog. Charlotte used to have a long stick to help her move around, but having a guide dog allows her much more freedom and makes her feel safer.\nHowever, the association says there is a worryingly _ supply of services for the young blind people across the UK, and it calls for national standards to be introduced.

In fact, they were shot from 1914 through 1916, most of them after a disastrous shipwreck , by a cameraman who had no reasonable expectation of survival. Many of the images were stored in an ice chest, under freezing water, in the damaged wooden ship.\nThe ship was the Endurance, a small, tight, Norwegian-built three-master that was intended to take Sir Ernest Shackleton and a small crew of seamen and scientists, 27 men in all, to the southernmost shore of Antarctica's Weddell Sea. From that point Shackleton wanted to force a passage by dog sled  across the continent. The journey was intended to achieve more than what Captain Robert Falcon Scott had done. Captain Scott had reached the South Pole early in 1912 but had died with his four companions on the march back.\nAs writer Caroline Alexander makes clear in her forceful and well-researched story The Endurance, adventuring was even then a thoroughly commercial effort. Scott's last journey, completed as be lay in a tent dying of cold and hunger, caught the world's imagination, and a film made in his honor drew crowds. Shackleton, a onetime British merchant-navy officer who had got to within 100 miles of the South Pole in 1908, started a business before his 1914 voyage to make money from movie and still photography. Frank Hurley, a confident and gifted Australian photographer who knew the Antarctic, was hired to make the images, most of which have never before been published.",

        "passage": "Jogging has become the most popular individual sport in America. Many theories,even some mystical ones,have been advanced to explain the popularity of jogging. The plain truth is that jogging is a cheap,quick and efficient way to maintain (or achieve) physical fitness.\nThe most useful sort of exercise is exercise that develops the heart,lungs, and circulatory systems. If these systems are fit,the body is ready for almost any sport and for almost any sudden demand made by work or emergencies. One can train more specifically,as by developing strength for weight lifting or the ability to run straight ahead for short distances with great power as in football,but running trains your heart and lungs to deliver oxygen more efficiently to all parts of your body. It is worth doing that: this sort of exercise is the only kind that can reduce heart disease, the number one cause of death in America.\nOnly one sort of equipment is needed--a pair of good shoes. Physicians advise beginning joggers not to try to run in tennis or gym shoes. Many design advances have been made in only the last several years that make a pair of excellent running shoes indispensable if a runner wishes to develop as quickly as possible,with as little chance of injury as possible. A pair of good running shoes will have soft pads for absorbing shock, as well as slightly built-up heels and full heel cups that will give the knee and ankle more stability. A wise investment in good shoes will prevent blisters and the foot,ankle and knee injuries and will also enable the wearer to run on paved or soft surfaces. No other special equipment is needed; you can jog in any clothing you desire,even your street clothes.\nIt takes surprisingly little time to develop the ability to run. The American Jogging Association has a twelve-week program designed to move from a fifteen- minute walk (which almost anyone can manage who is in reasonable health) to a thirty-minute run. A measure of common sense,a physical examination,and a planned schedule are all it takes.",

A marvelous opportunity is offered here for you to experience working with these giant animals. The daily highlight is the walk from the elephant orphanage down to the river to bathe the elephants. Imaging what an amazing fun it is to watch an entire herd splashing  around and rolling in the river just feet in front of you!\nThis opportunity is available through a programme designed for visitors and volunteers to work in the world-famous government-run elephant orphanage in Pinnawela, Sri Lanka. The orphanage is regarded as one of the largest centers of its kind in the world, with one of the most successful captive breeding  programmes for Asian elephants.\nPinnawela Orphanage is situated in the hills of central Sri Lanka. It was established in 1975 by the Sir Lanka Wildlife Department. The orphanage's 24 acres  are a home for the many baby elephants found in the jungle without their mothers. In most of these cases the mothers had either died or been killed. Baby elephants cared for by the orphanage are released into the wild when they reach a certain age.\nThe volunteers' working hours are quite short so there is plenty of time to sightsee and explore. The volunteer work consists mainly of the day-to-day aspects of running the orphanage, rather than more specialized research-based work.\nThe volunteers' main duties are cleaning the elephant homes in the morning (hard, muddy work!) and bathing some of the smaller elephants. Some elephants are overly large or have not been tamed or trained to a satisfactory level. However there are still enough opportunities to have full hands-on contact safely.\nWhile the mahouts are bathing the larger elephants, you will have a chance to relax by the river, chat with the mahouts and watch the elephants play and interact with humans and each other. It is an  ly beautiful sight. Being around these serene animals in such a beautiful setting can have a very calming effect!\nIf you are interested in such an experience, contact us for more information.",

In this coming century, we'll be re-engineering the brain a piece at a time, first with implants  and finally engineering an complete replacement.

Heaven's a place where you can create worlds at will, and the ideal Heaven is where you run the whole thing yourself. The current means of getting to Heaven involve various supernatural systems for which, at this point, there's no scientific evidence.

The sounds that make up this language are made by whistling, rather than by speaking.\nThe language was brought to the island by African setters many centuries ago. To communicate among the  _ populated inland hills and valleys, shepherds   had to use the whistled language, which could be heard and understood over distances of up to eight kilometers, compared to about 200 meters for a spoken word.\nWith the development of new technologies like the cellphone, the number of Silbo Gomero whistlers has declined to around 1,000. Many of the older generation of islanders fear the language, which they consider to be a cultural symbol, may become extinct.\nTo save Silbo Gomero, Busuu.com, a website based in Madrid, has launched a movement to teach Internet users worldwide to communicate using the language's unique whistles. \"We really like the whole story of Silbo Gomero because it is really a fun language, \" said Bernard Niesner, the company's co-founder.\n Niesner says one of the founding principles of the website was to promote learning languages in danger of extinction. \"If Busuu.com really works out like we think, it would be an amazing tool for language learning all over the world,\" Niesner said. \"The name of our website itself comes from Busuu, a language that is spoken by only eight people.\"",

When you start being concerned about things which are not related to you, you lose your control on your thought process, which often has negative results disturbing the mental peace. Basically, your mind starts wandering here and there. So next time an unnecessary thought comes to your mind, think whether this is really something you should be worrying for? If not, keep it away and focus on something positive, practical and fruitful.\n2. Surround yourself with positive people.\n _ negative comments and stay away from negative souls. When someone is negative, he spreads negativity and you get affected. Staying with such people will have long term influence on your character so think about your company.\n3. Don't think about others too much.\nRemember: _ Don't allow your brain to compare yourself to others as this is an insult   to yourself. Don't be jealous; it's a heart killing disease, get rid of it as soon as possible. When you are jealous you focus on finding faults in others even if they don't have. This poisons your soul and steals the mental peace.\n4. You can't keep everyone happy.\nDon't be oversensitive  . Be natural in what you do. Be positive and constructive in your deeds and then don't really care too much about others. Be aware, don't apply this to too closed relations. Develop trust to build up powerful relationships.\n5. Don't believe yourself to be unlucky.\nRemember this: Bad luck happens to everyone. It's not your fault at all. Time, whether good or bad, passes quickly. Develop the power of not looking back into your past. Believe in the power of Now. Believe in your skills. Work hard and you will get what you have been entitled for.

If those microorganisms could be identified, we could put them to work eating the plastic much faster than under normal conditions.\nWith this goal in mind, he ground plastic bags into a powder and concocted  a solution of household chemicals, yeast  and tap water to encourage microbes growth. Then he added the plastic powder and let the microbes work their magic for 3 months. Finally, he tested the resulting bacterial culture on plastic bags, exposing one plastic sample to dead bacteria as a control. Sure enough, the plastic exposed to the live bacteria was 17% lighter than the control after six weeks.\nThe inputs are cheap: maintaining the required temperature takes little energy because microbes produce heat as they work, and the only outputs are water and tiny levels of carbon dioxide.\n\"Almost every week I have to do chores and when I open the closet door, I have piles of plastic bags falling on top of me.

Decades ago, Kodak invented the first digital camera in 1975 -- but in a fateful decision, the company chose to focus on its traditional film business. \nLarge companies have a difficult time switching into new markets. For example, although Kodak predicted the rise of digital photography, its culture was too rooted in the successes of the past to fully welcome the future. In the past, their history was so important to them. Now their history has become a liability. \nKodak's downfall over the last several decades was dramatic. The 1980s brought new competition from Japanese film company Fuji Photo, which weaken Kodak by offering lower prices. Kodak's decision not to pursue the role of official film for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics was a major loss. The bid went instead to Fuji, which exploited  its sponsorship to win a key role in the market.",

The College Board announced that the new SAT will no longer test students on rarely used words. But it will include passages from American historical documents or from writings on freedom and human rights.\nThe College Board says words on the new test will be related to usage. Students will be asked to tell the meaning of words according to the context of the reading passages. Nigerian student Peace Umoru is in her first year at Howard University. She says the rarely used words are the hardest part for international students. The new test will be easier because of the reform.\nEddie West is with the College Board. He says the new test will better predict a student's performance in college. The changes are moving the test in a positive direction. The new SAT pays more attention to skills and abilities that students need to succeed. The addition of material about American historical documents could make the test harder for international students. After all, they live in different countries with different cultures. But it's a good chance for them to understand the Declaration of Independence or Martin Luther King's work, or anything else that might be tested.\nStudents from other countries, particularly those who did not grow up learning English, may feel it is more difficult.

If one is thinking in terms of science fiction and the space age, it is at least possible to assume that man will have solved such trivial and earthly problems as housing. Writers of science fiction, from H.G. Wells onwards, have had little to say on the subject. They have conveyed the suggestion that men will live in great comfort, with every imaginable apparatus  to make life smooth, healthy and easy, if not happy. But they have not said what his house will be made of. Perhaps some new building material, as yet unimagined, will have been discovered or invented at least. One may be certain that bricks and mortar(,) will long have gone out of fashion.\nBut the problems of the next generation or two can more readily be imagined. Scientists have already pointed out that unless something is done either to restrict the world's rapid growth in population or to discover and develop new sources of food (or both), millions of people will be dying of starvation or at the best suffering from underfeeding before this century is out. But nobody has yet worked out any plan for housing these growing populations. Admittedly the worst situations will occur in the hottest parts of the world, where housing can be light structure or in backward areas where standards are traditionally low. But even the minimum shelter requires materials of some kind and in the teeming, bulging towns the low-standard \"housing\" of flattened petrol cans and dirty canvas is far more wasteful of ground space than can be tolerated.\nSince the war, Hong Kong has suffered the kind of crisis which is likely to arise in many other places during the next generation. Literally millions of refugees arrived to swell the already growing population and emergency steps had to be taken rapidly to prevent squalor and disease and the spread crime. The city is tackling the situation energetically and enormous blocks of tenements are rising at an astonishing aped. But Hong Kong is only one small part of what will certainly become a vast problem and not merely a housing problem, because when population grows at this rate there are accompanying problems of education, transport, hospital services, drainage, water supply and so on. Not every area may give the same resources as Hong Kong to draw upon and the search for quicker and cheaper methods of construction must never stop.",

It was a string of earthquakes that made the small town shake all the time.This went on for more than a year.Sometimes the quakes were very small.Only certain instruments could pick them up.At other times, the quakes damaged houses and land.The people were always afraid.They wished they knew how to stop the ground from shaking.\nPeople all over the world would like to know when an earthquake is coming.But an earthquake is almost always a surprise.Under the surface of the Earth, huge blocks of rock drift apart or slide against each other.The ground above splits apart or rumbles and shakes.\nSome scientists hope to predict quakes by keeping a close watch on animals.It seems that some animals can sense an earthquake coming.In 1969, animals in a Chinese zoo began to act funny one day.Swans flew out of their pond.A panda sat down, covered its eyes with its paws, and groaned.The animals seemed to know that something was about to happen.And it did.An earthquake struck.What was it that the animals sensed? Scientists are trying to find out.\nKeeping close track of the Earth's magnetic force in earthquake areas may also help.A few years ago, in Hollister, CA, scientists kept a record of the area's magnetic pull.For one week, the force grew stronger.Then it weakened suddenly.A day later, an earthquake struck.\nIt may become possible to know when and where an earthquake will happen.But it will be much harder to stop one from happening.\nMany scientists think that the Earth's covering is not smooth.They say the earth's \"skin\" is made up of huge puzzle pieces called plates.Land and ocean floors make up these huge plates.Under the Earth's crust  , or plates, is hot rock.The plates float on top of this rock.Sometimes the rock forces its way through the crust.What happens then? A volcano is born! More often, the rock moves and forces the plates to pull away from each other, causing earthquakes to happen.(Volcanoes and earthquakes often go together.)\nSometimes, the plates end up on top of each other.When this happens, the land above may look strange.Seen from the air, there seems to be a long scar in the Earth.This is called a fault  .The areas along faults have more earthquakes than other parts of the Earth.\nFor now, we'll just have to shake along with the Earth.It goes through millions of small earthquakes every year.With luck, you won't feel a thing!",

We say, \"Nice song.\" \"Honey, you don't look fat in that, no.\" But another study showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes of meeting each other. We lie more to strangers than we lie to coworkers. Men lie eight times more about themselves than they do other people. Women lie more to protect other people. If you're married, you're going to lie to your wife/ husband in one out of every 10 communications. If you're unmarried, that number drops to three. But look, if at some point you got lied to, it's because you agreed to get lied to. Truth about lying: lying's a cooperative act. Not all lies are harmful. Sometimes we're willing to lie for the sake of social dignity  , maybe to keep a private secret.\nLying is complex. It's woven into the fabric of our daily and business lives. We're deeply disturbed by the truth. We explain it, sometimes for very good reasons, other times just because we don't understand the gaps between ideals and realities in our lives. We're against lying, but secretly we're for it in ways that our society has practiced for centuries and centuries. It's as old as breathing. It's part of our culture and history. Think the stories from Dante, Shakespeare, the Bible, News of the World.\nLying has great value to the evolution of human being. Researchers have long known that the more intelligent the species, the more likely it is to lie. We human like to become leaders. It starts really early. How early? Well, babies will pretend to cry, pause, wait to see who's coming and then go right back to crying. One-year-olds learn hiding truth. Two-year-olds bluff  . Five-year-olds lie outright and try to control via flattery  . Nine-year-olds, masters of covering up. By the time you enter college, you're going to lie to your mom in one out of every five interactions. By the time we enter this work world to be breadwinners, we've entered a world that is just full of fake digital friends, business media, identity thieves, world-class cheats, ----in short, a post-truth society.\nWhat do you do? Well there are steps we can take to guide our way through the bushes. Trained lie spotters get to the truth 90% of the time. The rest of us, we're only 54% accurate. Why is it so easy to learn?

He was on his way to attend a three-day sales meeting when he had the flat. tyre. Unfortunately, he did not have a spare, so he pushed the car off the road, locked it up, and managed to thumb a ride back to Pine Grove. It was after eleven o'clock when he finally got home, and it was then that his real problems started.\nWhen Andrew left home at about 5:30, he had told his wife not to expect him back until Thursday or Friday. Knowing that his wife was nervous about staying in the house alone at night, Andrew took the precaution of checking all the windows in the house to be sure they were locked, so that he could report to his wife that the house was secure. He convinced his wife that the house was burglar-proof, and that she would be perfectly safe, providing she bolted  the front door as soon as he drove away.\nAndrew's only thought as he made his way in the dark to his front door was how surprised his wife was going to be to see him, since he was not supposed to be back until Thursday or Friday. He had forgotten about the bolt on the front door. When he turned his key in the lock and the door wouldn't _ he remembered the bolt. And he remembered that he had carefully locked all of the windows.\nAlthough Andrew didn't know it at the time, a next-door neighbor had seen him approaching the house and had watched him go up the steps to the front door. In the dark, it was impossible for the neighbor to recognize Andrew, and, besides, the neighbor knew that Andrew had gone out-of-town for a three-day meeting. As a matter of fact, Andrew had asked the neighbor to keep an eye on the house while he was gone.\nFinding that he couldn't get in, Andrew began pounding  on the front door to get his wife to open the door. According to Andrew, however, his wife is a very sound sleeper, and he knew it was going to be hard to wake her up. In the meantime, because of all the noise he had been making, the neighbor was convinced that somebody was trying to break into the house; so she called the police.\nWhen we talked to Andrew at the country jail this morning, he said that he still didn't understand how the police managed to circle the house without his seeing them. He stated that he had decided the only way to get in was to break one of the dining room windows, and that he was about, to hurl his briefcase into the window to break it when two of the officers grabbed him from behind.\nAndrew could not make the officers believe that he lived there; so they took him off to jail. Apparently, he did succeed in convincing them that they ought to wake up the woman in the house to check his story. But there was no answer when they knocked at the door. He tried to explain to them that his wife was a very sound sleeper, but they concluded there was nobody in the house.",

We don't expect you to take up jogging, backpacking, or hang gliding. we ask the sedentary vacationers to spend two to four hours a day doing things, such as walking the city streets, exploring a nature preserve, or taking a leisurely rowboat ride.\nThese kinds of activities aren't just good for your physical health. They improve your mental health, even your spiritual health. And they make vacations memorable and worthwhile. Here are some fresh ideas for active and healthy vacation.\nMake the morning your activity time. At that time it is most likely that the weather will be friendlier, your energy level higher, and your schedule emptier than later in the day.\nHave a walk at dawn or dusk. Such activity is called rejuvenation . Try to make this a daily routine of life away from home, and you will guarantee yourself both physical and spiritual youth.\nGet into the water as much as you can. Don't allow yourself to spend your entire time sitting in front of the water. Whether it is the ocean, a swimming pool, or a tree-lined lake, make sure you get into the water for swimming or games or even walking. Merely standing in waist-high water is a good workout, thanks to the action of the water. And you'll feel so much more alive!\nChoose a cruise for your trip. It's amazing how active you can be being stuck on a boat in the middle of the Atlantic. Most cruise ships offer numerous options for seaworthy exercise. During your sea and land trips you can burn calories as you swim, hike, dive, and horseback ride.\nGet out of the car every two hours. Many of us spend a large part of our vacations on the road, either getting to and from our destinations, or using the car for sightseeing. But no matter how beautiful the scenery is, great and memorable vacations don't happen in a car seat. Don't wait for tiredness or nature's call to get you to pull over.

In addition, I can only find large wonton wrappers, while many other stores carry both large and small and offer a more varied selection for their customers. Another example is Regent Brand Chili Seasoning. Though it is not a leading brand, it is still common on the shelves of other grocery stores in this area and is superior in flavor to its competitors. \nI sincerely hope to continue a relationship with your store, and I hope that you will consider the possibility of expanding your goods to be more competitive. \nYours truly, \nBob Watson",

G. Wells (The Time Machine and The War of the Worlds). Sci-Fi, as it is commonly shortened, is a fictional story in which science and technology have a significant influence on the characters and plot. Many such works are guesswork about what the future holds and how scientific findings and technological advances will shape humankind.\nWriting in the late 1800s, Jules Verne was remarkably successful in his 10 guesses about future technologies of air conditioning, automobiles, the Internet, television, and underwater, air, and space travel. Unbelievably, of all places from which to choose, Jules Verne guessed Tampa, Florida, USA as the launching site of the first project to the Moon, which was only 200 kilometers away from the actual 1969 location at Cape Canaveral, Florida.\nOne of the best-known science fiction books is Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell. Published in 1949, it was not meant as a prediction, but as a warning: Orwell was describing what he saw as the outcome of the ideas, trends, and emerging technologies of his time. Many invented terms from this novel have become common in everyday use, such as \"big brother\" and \"doublethink\". Even the author's name has been made into an adjective--Orwellian--and has become a warning descriptor for situations where privacy is lost and the individual becomes sacrifice under a totalitarian  government. Nineteen Eighty-Four was translated into sixty-five languages within five years of its publication, setting a record that still stands.\nWhat helps bring science fiction into being is usually a new discovery or innovation. The author creates an analysis of the potential influence and consequences and then wraps it in a pleasant story. For example, the beginning of space exploration was followed a few years later by the Star Trek television program and movie series. Advances in genetics  cause fantasies of the end of disease, horrors of eugenics , and thrillers where creatures disappearing long ago are brought back to life. The science fiction author's self-determined role is that of field glasses for humanity--searching the world of future possibilities upon the road which we are traveling.",

Jeannie brings things to Lee Ann and puts them in her lap.\nJeannie was trained at a place called Canine Companions for Independence, located on twelve acres of land in Santa Rosa (California). The land was donated   by the cartoonist Charles Shultz. \"We train four different types of dogs here,\" said Ken Kirsh, a dog trainer there. \"Hearing dogs, service dogs, skilled companion dogs, and facility dogs.\"\nTrainers work with Labrador retrievers and golden retrievers for hours a day, but not every dog is good enough to be a working dog.\nThe work is a serious business. Hearing dogs warn their owners of sounds like ringing telephones and doorbells. Other dogs work with disabled patients like eight-year-old Noah Habib who communicates with a special computer. He likes it when people come to ask him about his dog. His father says, \"People are really interested in the dog and will come over and ask to pet her and play with her, and ask about what she does, and these are people that normally might not approach us and want to talk to Noah.\"\nWhen Lee Ann Laraway comes home with Jeannie and her goods, Jeannie helps her open the door. \"You can train a dog to do a lot of things.\" said Lee Ann.",

Last week the Secure Digital Music Initiative, a combination of 100 music, electronics and high-tech companies announced that it agreed on a music format  known as MP3 which caused disagreement. Nowadays, more and more young people are fond of music that is played on their portable MP3 players. So this announcement attracted a lot of attention in both the producer and consumer sides.\n       MP3 allows the digital music in CDs to be made smaller to a tenth its size and still sounds great. MP3 songs are small enough to be traded online; they are made by the millions to the _ of record companies, which fear that everything ever released on disc will end up online for free. Traditional records and their sale may be greatly damaged by this new format of music, and for the music's sake, it is better conveyed in this new medium.\n       That's why the recording industry appealed to the court against little Diamond Multimedia when it started selling a portable MP3 player two years ago. Not only did Diamond win in court, but it also sold 100,000 Rios along the way. With half a dozen other companies racing to produce their own versions of the Rio for Christmas, what could the music industry do? They have no choice in their future, their success just depends on how they can deal with the new trend and cooperate with the electronics companies.\n       It couldn't ignore MP3, which has become the format of choice among new bands trying to advertise their pre-released songs. So the industry agreed on it on one condition: within 18 months, when a standard is adopted that allows piracy-protected music (free from being illegally copied) to be sold online, the electronics companies agree to make their players in line with it. This clears the way for the new magic MP3 players, which is both convenient and capable of carrying on much more music than traditional walkmans. What's next? Digitally pirated movies.

So scientists were trying hard to find ways to make pictures that can move. They made lots of experiments, but failed again and again. It was Eadweard Muybridge who finally succeeded. He was the first photographer to try this successfully. But how did he make it? It was an interesting story.\nBack in 1872, people didn't know exactly whether all four of a horse's hooves   left the ground at the same time when it was running. A gentleman called Leland Stanford made a bet with his friend about it. Most people believed that a horse always had one hoof on the ground, or it would fall over. But Stanford didn't think so.\nAt that time, it was hard to know who could win the bet, because a horse's legs move so fast that it is impossible to tell just by looking. So they needed a way to record the movement of a running horse. Then Stanford offered $25,000 to the famous photographer, Muybridge, to help find the answer. In the beginning, Muybridge failed to get clear images, but he didn't give up. He continued to improve his cameras. In 1878, after many experiments, he managed to get a sequence   of 12 photos. One of them clearly showed that all four of the horse's hooves were off the ground at the same time. And when the photos moved fast, people could see a horse running.\nThough is usually considered as the person who created the first movie in 1889, it was the work of Eadweard Muybridge and the bet that led to Edison's invention.",

But to a London taxi driver, driving is not an easy job. A taxi driver needs to have not only good driving skills but also a good knowledge of the city of London, from the loneliest street to the popular restaurant around. He has to be at the service of all kinds of passengers   at all times.\nA London taxi driver said the following about his job.\nDuring the night it is usual for him to stop two or three times for some food. He said, \"I never drink when I'm working, otherwise I'd lose my license  .\"\nHe normally goes home between two and three o'clock in the morning. There are times he has to stay longer and try to make more runs. He said, \"That's the worst thing about working for yourself. If you don't make money, no one is going to give it to you. \"\nLondon taxi drivers not only \"take\" but also \"give\". Every summer hundreds of poor children from London go for a day at the sea -- by taxi! There rides are paid by the taxi drivers. At the sea, they are met by the mayor   , and a lunch party is also held for the taxi drivers and the children. After a happy day's running around the beaches and visiting the market there, the children go home again by taxi, free of charge of course!",

In fact, scientists say monkeys and humans share a common ancestor.\nMonkeys make us smile, too, because they are creatures full of playful tricks. This is why many monkey expressions are about tricky people or playful acts. One of these expressions is monkeyshines, meaning tricks or foolish acts. So, when a teacher says to a group of students: \"Stop those monkeyshines right now!\", you know that the kids are playing, instead of studying.\nYou might hear that same teacher warn a student not to monkey around with a valuable piece of equipment. You monkey around with something when you are touching or playing with something you should leave alone. Also, you can monkey around when you feel like doing something, but have no firm idea of what to do.\n Monkey business usually means secret, maybe illegal, activities. A news report may say there is monkey business involved in building the new airport, with some officials getting secret payments from builders.\nYou may make a monkey out of someone when you make that person look foolish. Some people make a monkey out of themselves by acting foolish or silly.\nIf one monkey has fun, imagine how much fun a barrel of monkeys can have. If your friend says he had more fun than a barrel of monkeys at your party, you know that he had a really good time.\nMonkey suits are common names for clothes or uniforms soldiers wear. In earlier years, performing monkeys' tight-fitting, color1ful jacket looked similar to a military uniform. So, people began to call a military uniform a monkey suit.",

Bacteria live at temperatures of 600 degF or a higher in places where the heat comes from the deep earth. One of the most remarkable achievements that we can observe directly is the ability of the plants and animals in the desert.\nIn the Death Valley ,temperatures of 134 degF in the shade have been officially reported Yet lizards live there ,along with 600 species of plants, 30 species of mammals? and even fish. While the days are terribly hot, the nights are extremely cold. Temperatures can fall down by as much as 50 degF.\nPlants called xerophytes are perfectly adapted to the extremely dry conditions. These plants have survived by developing techniques for coping with their environment. Like all living things ,they must have water ,and they get it in several ways.\nThe mesquite and the prickly  pear pick up moisture in opposite ways. The mesquite sends its roots down as deep as 60 feet to tap the water table. The prickly pear, on the other hand ,spreads its roots wide. These roots are shallow but they pick up whatever moisture is available at ground level. The paloverde saves water by shedding leaves in times of extreme drought The barrel cactus makes sure of a water supply by storing water in the plant itself. The saguaro cactus stores so much water that it can survive years of drought. But even the saguaro will die sooner or later if there is no rain. All these plants ,although well adjusted to their environment, must eventually get water.\nEven if the parent plants die, there are always seeds to keep the species alive. Since the desert is so tough, thousands of seeds must be released to produce one plant. To get rooted, these seeds must have exactly the right conditions. They can lie dormant for months, even years, until a little water stimulates the sparks of life.",

Instead, he used it to buy wild land.\nRobinson has decided to donate 843 acres of his own personal _ to the Department of Natural Resources after his death, which can then be used to create a new state park. His generous donation is the same size as New York City's Central Park. It is said that it's the largest land donation to happen in the last 25 years.\nHow did he come up with this idea? For Robinson, the idea of donation came from his respect for the land and the environment. He doesn't have children to pass it onto. He hoped that someone would make full use of it, or the land would probably turn into wasteland. A green park filled with trees can at least help deal with global warming, in addition to producing fresh air.\nRobinson has lived here in a small wooden house since 1964.One room holds his bed, a few chairs and a desk. He said he didn't care how much his donation was worth. Tom Pounders who used to work for Robinson said, \"He doesn't think material objects are important.\" He also recalled that Robinson once repaired a broken tennis shoe with a spare tire.\nRobinson has just one request for the new park that will be established after his death.

Letters to the editor must carry the writer's full name, address and telephone number, although the information is not necessary for publication. This requirement to provide personal particulars is a clear indication that writers are responsible for what they say. When a writer wants his voice heard, he needs to claim ownership of his voice. Responsibility is the name of the game.\n\"People today prefer living together to putting their signatures on a marriage certificate because they refuse to accept responsibility for the relationship,\" said social worker Ken Yip, \"and this is what is causing a lot of family problems.\" When we sign a paper, for example, a business contract or a bank document, the signature is a seal of consent, an agreement to take the matter seriously. Most governments and many organizations will not process written complaints if they do not bear the writer's signature. The absence of a signature, they explain, tells us that the writer cannot be too serious and therefore does not deserve a reply.\nThere are people who wish to remain anonymous  for various reasons. Multi-billionaire Mr. King donates generously to charity several times a year. He gives simply because he wants to help but not for the publicity his donations may bring, and he doesn't want his good deeds to make news. In other cases, people insist on anonymity because they are afraid of the consequences of revealing their identity. Crime witnesses may be willing to assist the police, but most are unwilling to give their names when reporting a crime.\nName or no name? The answer is very personal and lies in how much we want to get involved. We all have a name. It is a matter of responsibility to use it when we make a statement, a claim or an accusation. We all want to honor our own name, and it is only by stamping our expression of an opinion with our name that we honor what we say.",

If your argument can hold water, it is strong and does not have any holes.\nThrowing cold water also is an expression that deals with ideas or suggestions. It means to not like an idea.

There were other obstacles as well, but Bob viewed them all as opportunities.\nBob's mother says she feels very happy and proud that her son is about to graduate with honors, and remembers the sacrifices he's made to get there.  \"He has worked very hard.  He started something, and now he has finished it,\" Cathy says.  \"I have always told him, 'If this is your dream, then you can get it! Keep working hard and you can get it!'\"",

In fact, the supervisor often said unpleasant things to her.\nOne day, while talking with her friend Maria, she mentioned how discouraged she was.

        "passage": "The college entrance exam is not only a big challenge   for Chinese high school students, but also a very important exam in the lives of South Korean students.\nAlthough the long, cold winter has already started in South Korea, the annual   national exams have made the atmosphere very heated.\nMore than 675,000 South Korean high school graduates took the college entrance exam last Wednesday. They usually take exams in Korean, maths, sociology  , history and foreign languages.\nOfficially there is one college place for every 1.33 students. But because all the students want to go to the top universities in the country, the competition can reach one place for 10 students. The students want to attend these colleges for both their famous names and better job opportunities.\nBecause students face fierce competition, they have to study very hard to realize their dreams. Park Seung said he and his classmates often go to school before 7:30 a.m. After school has finished at 6:30 p.m., most of them go to the library to continue their study instead of returning home. Since many libraries in South Korea are open 24 hours a day, they often stay long into the night. Many of the Senior 3 students only sleep for three to four hours a day. \"I feel a lot of pressure, but I have to study very hard in order to make my dream come true. This is my lifetime goal and it will be a turning point in my life which could decide my future,\" Park said.\nThe exam day is a very serious day for the whole of South Korea. Vehicles are not allowed within a 200-metre radius   of all the test sites to make sure the students have quiet surroundings. Tooting   of horns is forbidden, even airplanes are ordered to avoid landing and take-off near the test sites during listening comprehension test hours.\nStudents are told their scores in December before they apply for college. This is followed by face-to-face oral tests. There are public and private universities in South Korea. Many private universities are well-known, but their fees can be 18, 000 yuan each term. This has made a lot of students think again.",

        "passage": "One of India's great economic advantages is the   youth of its population. To make the most of this advantage, India's children need to be educated. On paper, India is doing well here. The country has a nationwide network of state primary schools funded by a specially designed tax. 96% of children aged 6-14 go to school, even in rural areas. That's well above the average for the developing world and their attendance is good. But the attainment is poor: three quarters of third graders can't read a gradeone text and 53% of grade five kids can't read at the standard they should have achieved at grade two. Levels of achievement are almost as bad in math. \n\"The main problem in India is not school entry or whether there is a local school; it's the delivery of education, the way teaching is done or not done,\" says Vinati Sukhdev, the executive director of Pratham, a charity that campaigns for better education in India. And according to Ms. Sukhdev, the country's teachers are the thirdbestpaid in the world but they're poorly trained and are often absent. Teacher attendance at the primary level is only 85%, according to Pratham's research and there's little punishment for those who don't turn up. \nThe government knows that state schooling needs to improve. In 2009 it passed the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act (RTE), a law for the national provision of free, childfriendly education. It says that there should be two teachers for every 60 students and that they should go to work regularly, get there on time, follow the curriculum, assess how well the children are learning and meet regularly with parents. \n\"What we need to do next is improve accountability ,\" says Ms. Sukhdev. Schools have management committees that are supposed to include parent and local government representatives. \"But they don't work or people don't know they exist.\" Pratham tries to help local communities and parents drive improvement. \"You should see the kind of reaction we get when they realize the teacher is paid but isn't turning up!\"says Ms.  Sukhdev. \"We can't be everywhere, so we limit ourselves to working in a few districts, where we can create model schools. Then we try to work together with local government to make sure every school in the district or state is raised to that level.\"\nThe Read India programme is an example of what targeted help can achieve. Pratham has created an easytouse teaching and assessment pack called Learn to Read. It has trained teachers in how to use the pack at school and showed community health workers, volunteers and parents how it could support learning outside school. The programme has now run across 19 states, involving 450,000 volunteers and training 600,000 teachers and government workers. Among the 33 million children who have participated, the number of those who can read simple sentences has risen by 20%.",

How do you feel when you are full? When you are eating, notice how your body feels and when your stomach feels comfortably full. Eating too much will not make you feel comfortable and make you fat.\nFourth, limit  screen times. Screen time is the time you watch TV, DVDs and videos, or using computers. It is good to take more exercise, such as basketball, bike riding and swimming. You can't watch TV for more than two hours a day.\nFifth, be active.

The rabbits were born at the University of Istanbul as part of the cooperation between scientists from universities in Turkey and Hawaii.\nThe rabbits glow to show that a genetic operation technique can work efficiently. \"The green is not important at all--it's just a marker to show the experiment can be done successfully,\" said University of Hawaii associate professor, Stefan Moisyadi.\nTo produce the glowing effect, researchers injected jellyfish DNA into a mother rabbit's embryos. Then those embryos were put into the mother. Similar experiments have resulted in glowing cockroaches  and cats.\nEventually, the researchers hope the technique can lead to new ways to produce medicines, Moisyadi said.\n\"The final goal is to develop animals that are able to produce beneficial molecules in their milk that can be cheaply extracted , especially in countries that cannot afford big factories that make drugs, which usually cost US$1bn to build. Then they will be able to produce their own protein-based medication in animals,\" Moisyadi said.\nThe rabbits are expected to live as long as non-glowing rabbits, but Moisyadi said he understands people can object to this kind of experimentation involving live animals. \"To the people against, I say: think, what are the benefits and what is the harm?\" Moisyadi said. \"And if the benefits outweigh the harm, let's go with the benefits.\"\nMoisyadi started developing the project in 2006, and researchers are now waiting to see if pregnant sheep produce similar results.",

But the method has only limited success because they cannot stay long underwater, nor reach depths of over 200 meters where some of the deep-sea coral grows.\nHowever,this is not the case for Coralbots--the robots that can constantly seek out broken branches.A team of 'coral bots',each individually working to simple rules will piece together damaged bits of coral, allowing them to regrow. They are programmed to be able to distinguish between other things and the coral.The robots work together in groups,similar to bees.If one coralbot is damaged, then the others will still be able to complete the task.\nDr Lea-Anne Henry said:\"The project of using coralbots offers us the possibility to restore  the function of reefs.It is in the final stage of testing.Once ready, the researchers hope to build hundreds of _ and use them effectively in the waters off Scotland and then hopefully in the oceans across the world.\"",

His family later moved to New Haven, Connecticut.\nAt the age of fourteen, he began to play the saxophone and then the clarinet. From a very young age, Artie Shaw wanted to play his clarinet better than anyone. He wanted his sound and music to be perfect. He worked at this task much of his life.\nHe began working as a professional musician when he was fifteen. He left home and began playing in bands across the United States.\nIn 1928, young Artie Shaw traveled to Chicago, Illinois to hear the great trumpet player, Louis Armstrong. He immediately understood that Armstrong's great jazz sound was the beginning of something new and exciting. Artie left Chicago with a growing interest in jazz music. Soon after, he moved to New York City.\nHe got work playing the clarinet for the Columbia Broadcast System radio network. In 1936, he was given a chance to form a small group and play at New York's famous Imperial Theater on Broadway. His group was not the top band in the show. But the crowd loved his music. This proved to be a major step in his career.\nArtie Shaw was always trying something new, something different. He heard a young black woman sing and hired her for his band. This was the first time that a black woman sang with white musicians. Racial separation was the rule in many states. Artie Shaw did not care.\nArtie Shaw wrote several books in his later years. He wrote stories for magazines. He spoke about music at colleges and universities. But he had very little to do with the world of recording or music. During those years however, he received many awards and honors for his music. These included a Hall of Fame award from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.",

This isn't because people feel thankful for the cold weather, nor because the important festivals---Christmas or Spring Festival---offer an excuse to celebrate. In fact, \"Bless you!\" is a common response if someone sneezes, a symptom of catching a cold or the flu.\nColds and the flu are the most common illnesses of autumn and winter as the weather gets colder. Viruses cause them. If you get one you will feel annoyed, but it is not usually serious. The flu is spread from person to person when we come into contact with a person with the virus. We get the virus on our hands and then we touch our noses and our mouths. We can pass on the flu before we realize we have it. You can infect  others one day before symptoms develop and for up to five days after becoming sick.\nGetting a flu vaccination is the best way to prevent the illness. Even if your body has built up antibodies for one kind of flu. The vaccine is only effective for one year and viruses are different from year to year, so it is necessary to get a flu vaccination every year. The best time to get the vaccination is October or November. Besides, there are other ways to reduce your chance of getting a flu. Wash your hands. Get enough rest. Eat garlic regularly.

Oil ,coal and wood are all fuels that release the gas .When biological waste breaks down ,it also releases carbon dioxide.\n       However ,plants use carbon dioxide in the process called photosynthesis. This process provides food for almost all life on Earth. Some groups that support burning oil and coal want to increase the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere . They oppose international efforts to control carbon dioxide.\n       Some scientists believe that forests and trees are able to capture large amounts of carbon dioxide from the air. Some groups even suggest that an increase in carbon dioxide could cause plants to grow faster.\n       A recent study inNorth Carolinafound that more carbon dioxide in the air could cause trees to grow faster .But the researchers found the effect appears to last for only three years. Another study showed that much of the carbon dioxide that is taken in by trees in released within three years.

It is one of the biggest differences between Chinese and Western eating habits. In China a few dishes are placed in the center of a table and shared by all. Also, you should offer thanks when a Chinese host takes food from one of the dishes on the table and places it on your plate. Refusing it would not be polite even if you are full.\nStep2:\nRespect the chopsticks. The chopsticks are the single most important tool at a Chinese table. Use the chopsticks to grab food and never skewer   it. Also make sure to place your chopsticks over your bowl or plate. Don't lay them on the table or even worse, stick them into the rice bowl.\nStep3:\nUse communal chopsticks. To take food from the center of the table you should use the communal chopsticks or spoons that are placed there for that purpose. If there are no communal tools, use the other ends of your chopsticks to take food, remembering not to use the other end to put food into your mouth.\nStep4:\nRespect the elders. Table manners in China place extra respect on elders. At the table, pass food to your elders before taking it for yourself. If someone makes a toast, make sure that when you clink glasses with someone older than you, the rim of your glass is lower than the rim of the elder person.",

After several years, however, the boss promoted Bobby to the position of manager but John remained an ordinary employee . John could not take it any more, so he sent his resignation  and complained that the boss did not value hard working workers but only promoted those who said good words of him.\nThe boss knew that John worked very hard for the years. He thought for a moment and said, \"Thank you for telling me, but I have a request. I hope you will do one more thing for our company before you leave. Perhaps you will change your mind and take back your resignation.\"\nJohn agreed. The boss asked him to go and find out anyone selling watermelons in the market. John went and returned soon. He said he had found out a man selling watermelons. The boss asked how much per kg, John shook his head and went back to the market to ask and returned to tell the boss $1.2 per kg.\nThe boss told John to wait a second, and he called Bobby to go and find anyone selling watermelons in the market. Bobby went, returned and said only one person sold watermelons. $1.2 for a kg, $10 for 10kg and his watermelons added up to 340. On the table 58 melons, every melon weighs about 2 kg, bought from the south two days ago and they were fresh, red and good quality.\nJohn was surprised and realized the difference between himself and Bobby. He decided not to go away but to learn from Bobby.\nThe story tells us that a more successful person is more concerned and thinks more. Chances are there in the daily details. For the same thing, a person sees one year ahead, while another sees only tomorrow. The difference between a year and a day is 365 times, how could you win?",

        "passage": "For some reason, it takes constant reminders that weprimates need nurturing.\nIn a recent study of 46 babychimpanzee orphans, Kim Bard of the University of Portsmouth in England and her colleagues demonstrated that primate babies that have tight relationships with mother figures do much better oncognitive tests than babies who receive only food, shelter, and friendship with peers. But this is not breaking mews. In fact, it's old news.\nIn the 1950s, Harry Harlow conducted a series of experiments with baby monkeys that showed, without doubt, that lack of love and comfort makes for a crazy monkey.\nHarlow constructed a cage that included a wire monkey \"mother\" topped with a plastic face. In this wire he fixed Mom with a milk bottle. The cage also held another wire mother covered with terry cloth. The baby monkeys spent all their time with the cloth mother and only went to the wire mother to feed, demonstrating that a soft touch beat something to eat any day.\nHarlow's monkey work was important because, at the time, child care \"experts\" and everybody's grandmother had a \"no touch, no comfort\" policy toward children. They advised parents not to respond to crying babies, felt babies should sleep alone to grow up independent, and for God's sake put those kids down. But Harlow's work changed all that. Mothers were soon permitted to have their newborns next to them in the hospital.\nThe current chimp research based on Harlow's work shows that mother love not only makes for a psychologically well-adjusted child, but also makes for a smart kid. Bard and her colleagues evaluated the abilities of the chimps when they were 12 months old with standard human tests for children of that age, tests that ask little kids to imitate some action.\nThe highly raised chimps did better than the ones that were not loved, and what do you know, the well-raised chimps did even better than human kids on this small IQ test.\nSo we hear it once again. We are primates, social animals which need care and love. We need to be held and talked to and made to feel that at least one person wants to be with us all the time. And if we get that kind of connection, we are sure to be fine, even better than fine.",

Once again I spelt out directions even a blind person could follow. I glanced impatiently at my watch, and waited. Only two hours remained until my flight left--and it was an hour and a half trip to the airport.\nOutside, heavy rains were pouring down. My house was so far north in the city that buses pass only here times a day.\nThe telephone rang again. \"Terribly sorry,\" began the man at the taxi company. Then I realized that the taxi company, flooded with calls, could only offer in-city runs. I had heard this happens when the weather gets bad. I shouted into the phone that I had a plane to catch and I would meet the taxi outside my house.\nStanding in the wind-driven rain, I looked up and down the road. No taxi. A car went by, the driver and passenger staring at the crazy foreigner in the downpour.\nFinally a white car appeared and pulled to a stop. A young man threw open the door, waving for me to get in. Shaking with cold and anger, I climbed in.\nIn the most polite Japanese, the man said he was called Mike, with who I had spoken three times that morning. He had left his post in the office and raced here in his personal car. He apologized again, but didn't explain why a taxi would not pick me up. Delivering me straight to the airport, he refused the 2,000 yen I pressed into his hand.\nA few hours later, as the storm-delayed 727 took off, I opened the newspaper.

When she and her twin sister, Miriam, arrived in the Auschwitz death camp, they were met by Josef Mengele and became part of the cruel scientist's experiments. Groning was a junior squad leader at the camp.\nWhile Groning could argue he was not directly responsible for procedures carried out on twins,nor for the mass murder of so many others, he played a critical role in the effort to kill Jews.\nAfter the war Groning led an ordinary, quiet life until he became alarmed by the rise of Holocaust deniers. He went public with his role and in September 2014 was charged as an accessory  to murder.\nWhen Groning went on trial in April 2015, Eva Mozes Kor was called as a witness. After her session, she walked straight up to the 93-year-old former Nazi and shook his hand.\nEva Mozes Kor will never forget nor excuse what the Nazis did. Her two books make that clear: Surviving the Angel of Death. and the earlier Echoes from Auschwitz. She has also spent her post-war years drawing attention to the Holocaust, in the hope of preventing a repeat of its horrors.\nAt the same time,  she is dedicated ( ) to healing rather than revenge. As she wrote in a Facebook post:\nForgiving does not mean forgetting-we all want to prevent these things from ever happening again. Forgiveness is about self-healing, self-liberation, and self-empowerment...

Maybe, going abroad is an opportunity to look again at not only the country and the people who live there but also ourselves.\nI had never expected to visit Paris. The French culture didn' t interest me that much, and Paris seemed too big, too touristy, too much. But when I found myself standing next to the Opera National de Paris, completely alone and totally lost, I knew I was in for an interesting ride. I had decided to take a summer history class abroad, and Paris just happened to be where it was set. My teacher eventually found me and other jet-lagged students and walked us down to where we would be staying. Even then, tired, hungry, and feeling displaced, I was unable to keep myself from marveling at the beauty of the city.\nThe next day in the grocery store, trying to decide if the box I was holding contained butter or cream cheese, I suddenly realized I was a foreigner that didn't speak the language.The cashier and I had a conversation completely with gestures. For the most part, it didn't seem to bother the French that I was utterly incompetent in speaking their language. In fact, from my first unclear \"bonjour\" , many of them would directly switch over to English.\nTime Hew by. In the mornings we had class, and in the afternoons we were given a lot of freedom to do what we pleased. We explored everywhere in the city, becoming experts at using the Metro, and walking so much that our legs were sore every night.\nLiving in Paris was a huge change in my lifestyle. Everything I did was more relaxed. I stopped worrying about the future and instead focused on living in the present. I stopped wearing a watch because time didn't matter.We ate when we were hungry, went to bed when we were tired and explored in between.I no longer mind that Paris is so big; it' s an old, beautiful metropolis full of culture and history.On one of my last days there, standing on top of the Arc du Triumph with a 360 degree view of Paris, I finally admitted something to myself.The city that I had never wanted to visit had turned into the city that I never wanted to leave.",

But over the last ten years or so, more of them have moved in that direction, including high schools. Students may have to wear a specially purchased uniform. Or they may just have to dress alike~for example, white shirts and dark color1ed pants or skirts.\nEven schools that do not require uniforms generally have a dress code or other rules about what they consider acceptable. Policies commonly ban clothing that shows offensive  images or words, or simply too much skin. Items like hats may be not permitted because ,for example, different color1s may be connected with violent gangs.\nSome parents like the idea of uniforms. They say it means they do not have to spend as much on clothing for their kids. Others, though, argue that uniforms represent an unnecessary cost There are also debates about whether uniforms or other dress policies break civil rights.\nStudents and parents have taken legal action against school dress requirements. Just last week, a judge blocked a middle school in Napa, California, from enforcing a dress code unless families have a way out of it The American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California brought the case for the families of several students who werfe punished Most attention centered on a girl who wore socks with the Tigger character from Winnie the PooK\nThe school said its clothing policy, including no pictures of any kind, was needed to control a growing problem with gangs.

Or can we assume that without any opponent, we can't tell a contestant is winning because he is really talented or because there's no comparison?\nThe administrative department really contributed a lot in the popularity of the voice of China. In the past, there was no other draft shows  ranked as high as Super GirlandSuper Boy. Even though there were some draft shows which seemed to share the popularity, it never turned out ture. All the other draft shows were shodowed by the ones on Hunan TV. One example was that since draft shows of Hunan TV were broadcast on Friday night, the draft shows of other stations were shifted to Saturday or Sunday. However, Hunan TV didn't get their permission for broadcasting shows in 2012.\nAnd if this were not bad enough, SARFT did a great favor for it. SARFT issued a regulation, saying that all draft shows should be broadcast after 10:30 pm at night. Zhejiang TV declared long before the regulation that since was \"no audition , no PK, no rise in rank, no voting, no champion\", its program was never a draft show. So, in 2012, all the opponents of Zhejiang TV had to broadcast their draft shows after 10:30 pm while the voice of Chinawas permitted to be broadcast in prime time.\nIf you really think about it, there's no esential different between a draft show and the voice of China. It also selected people from all over the country, how did they say this were different from a draft show? No PK,really? PK doesn't mean one versus one! A team versus a team is called PK too. And \"no rise in rank?\" is just a switch of concepts because at the end of every game, some left the stage and some stayed. If there was really \"no champion\", how come there was only one \"good voice of China\" at the final round? All these were rising in rank, in disguise .\nUnder such cimcumstance, the voice of Chinaeven got praise. We are not saying that it is not a good show: we are saying that there's regret about the show since it had no opponent.",

The number on each book tells you exactly what kind of book it is. This system is also useful for knowing where to go in the library to find a book.\nIn this system, there are ten large groups of books. Each of these groups has its own number, such as 100, 200, etc. So, for example, any books about language will have a number 400. On the other hand, any books about history will have a number 900. So, a number in the hundreds place tells you what general group a book is in. If you find a book that has a number in the 500s, you know it is a book about science.\nHowever, science is a big group, so the tens place is used to make a more detailed set of science books. For example, math books are included in the group of science books. Math books all have numbers between 510 and 519. Books about the history of Africa have numbers between 960 and 969.\nThe system uses the ones place to give a more exact limit for the subject of a book. A book on the history of South Africa will have the number 968.\nAs you can see, it is a simple system to use as long as you understand what the numbers mean.

He must have slid out that 20 euro note at the same time. I did not even notice until an hour later. I felt so stupid.\"\nAccording to neuroscientists, the key requirement for a successful pickpocket is not having nifty   fingers, it's having a working knowledge of the loopholes   in our brain. The most important of these loopholes is the fact that our brains are not set up to multi-task. Most of the time that is a good thing -- _ allows us to filter   out all but the most important features of the world around us. But a good trickster can use it to against you. This kind of trick involves capturing all of somebody's attention with other movements. Street pickpockets often use this effect to their advantage by manufacturing a situation that can not help but overload your attention system. Other strategies are more psychological. Pickpockets tend to hang out a \"beware of pickpockets\" signs, because the first thing people do when they read it is check they still have their valuables, helpfully giving away where they are. And in my mom's case, the thief's best trick was not coming across like a pickpocket. \"He was a very nice guy and very confident. Not someone that would cause you to suspect,\" she says. Apollo Robbins, a stage pickpocket, said smart move, like moving your hand in an arc   motion rather than a straight line, is another popular strategy employed by tricksters.\nAt last, it should be pointed out that most thefts are opportunistic.

        "passage": "As the Internet's influence grows, the potential for danger also escalates  . One of these dangers is from cyber-bullying. Cyber-bullying   is repeatedly hurting someone else through the use of technology. It consists of sending or posting cruel messages, photos, or videos on the Internet or other electronic media with the intent of damaging the reputation of the target. Imagine being a 13-year-old girl discovering a cell phone picture of her changing clothes for gym class has been sent to all her classmates. Or imagine being an 11-year-old boy who is scared to go to school because an unknown bully sent him an instant message saying that he is so fat that he should kill himself. Cases such as these are happening every day, leading kids to be depressed and unable to concentrate.\nWorse yet, parents are oblivious   to what is happening. Only 15 percent of parents even know what cyber-bullying is. And anyone who thinks that their child is not a victim or a bully is probably wrong. 90 percent of middle school students have had their feelings hurt online and 75 percent have admitted to visiting a website attacking another student.\nUnlike traditional schoolyard bullying, where a bully has a name and a face, cyber-bullying gets much of its power from anonymity  . A cyber bully might design a website posting cruel remarks about a classmate and never tell anyone that he or she was the creator. The cyber-bullying also gets its power from the scope   of its audience. Within seconds, a cyber bully can send an e-mail to everyone he or she knows, inviting them to take part in an online poll   of who is the ugliest kid in their class. Victims can be picked on day and night from any place.\nThe good news is that you can help stop cyber-bullying. By making parents and educators aware of what is going on and encouraging them to take quick and strong action when cyber-bullying cases happen, you can help make technology constructive, not destructive, for young people.",

It's made from inexpensive materials, and the user gets exercise while pedaling to operate a machine.\n\"You pedal the bike, and you can mix any drink you want,\" Renato said.

Dogs and cats have been popular Christmas gifts in the gifts in the UK and Europe for many years. But some people still haven't quite got the message.\nThe slogan still holds good. Some 105,000 dogs were _ by local government last year because they had been abandoned, many of them shortly after the festival season.\nThe main reason given by owners for handing their dogs over to the Dogs Trust is that the dogs need more attention than they can give; behavioral problems and moving home are also reasons given.\nBut Eleanor Silk, the Trust's communications director, says, \"It's often four or five months after Christmas, in early summer, when owners find that the dog has got too big and too active, or it hasn't been trained properly and has caused damage around the home.\"\nIn any case, some organizations that help pets are quick to point out that if you are serious about getting a puppy  as a pet, Christmas is not the time to do it. Puppies need to get used to their new surroundings, to be introduced to a routine, and to be looked after like small children. It's hard to meet any of these needs at Christmas. What's more, pulling a puppy out of a Christmas stocking in itself sends the wrong message to children. It encourages children to think of the puppy as a toy, rather than a responsibility.\nAppreciating what you're taking on with a dog can be a sobering   realization. \"For life\" means thinking about the effect they'll have on your life.

In experiments with 26 sleeping infants, each just 1 to 2 days old, scientists played a musical tone followed by a puff of air to their eyes 200 times over the course of a half-hour. 124 electrodes  stuck on the head and face of each baby recorded brain activity during the experiments. The babies rapidly learned to foretell a puff of air upon hearing the tone, showing a four-time increase on average in the chances of tightening their eyelids in response to the sound by the end of the experiments.\nAs newborns spend most of their time asleep, this newfound ability might be crucial to rapidly adapting to the world around them and help to ensure their survival, researchers said.\nJudging Characters Well\nJudging another person helpful or harmful is crucial when choosing friends. And that ability starts early. Kiley Hamlin of Yale University showed both 6-and 10-month-olds a puppet  show, in which one character helped another climb a hill. In another scene a third character pushed the climber down. The little ones then got to choose which character they preferred. For both age groups, most babies chose the helper character. This character-judging ability could be baby's first step in the formation of morals, Hamlin thought.",

Boys and girls have nearly two months' holiday before them as they leave school by train and car to return home to their fathers and mothers.\nThe summer holidays are the best part of the year for most children. The weather is usually good, so that one can spend most of one's time playing in the garden or, if one lives in the country, out in the woods and fields. Even if one lives in a big town, one can usually go to a park to play.\nThe best place for a summer holiday, however, is the seaside. Some children are lucky enough to live near the sea, but for the others who do not, a week or two at one of the big seaside towns is something that they will talk about for the whole of the following year.\nIn England, it is not only the rich who can take their children to the seaside; if a factory worker or a bus driver, a street cleaner or a waiter wants to take his wife and children to Southend or Margate, Blackpoor or Clacton, he is usually quite able to do so.\nNow, what is it that children like so much about the seaside? I think it is the sand, sea and sun more than any other things. Of course, there are lots of new things to see, nice things to eat, and exciting things to do, but it is the feeling of sand under one's feet, of salt water on one's skin, and of the warm sun on one's back that make the seaside what it is.",

        "passage": "In the market of luxury   brands, Chinese consumers are only second to the Japanese in the world.\nAcross the globe it's clear that the young generation are increasingly relying on expensive brands for their self-image.\nPersonally I am a fashion-lover, at least in spirit. I love to look at clothes and shoes. But I don't understand why people spend large amounts of money on designer labels. Certainly, young people, whether in China or elsewhere, should be building their self-confidence in other ways. When a young woman shows off a handbag worth two months' salary, that's a scary thing.\nWhat are the psychological factors forcing young people to take on debt for designer items?\nThe desire to say, \"Hey, look at me. I'm wealthy. I have social status.\"\nScientists have found the acquisition of luxury brands doesn't lead to happiness. Study after study has shown that, although we are born to desire material possessions, when we get them, we don't suddenly become \"happy people\".\nIn fact, a series of studies by Leaf Van Boven at the University of Colorado, US, have shown that individuals who invest   in travel and other experiences get more pleasure than those who invest in material things. That's because experiences are more easily combined into a person's identity. If I travel to Yunnan, that adventure affects how I think. My memories entertain my friends and colleagues. It follows, then, that investing in experiences improves my chances for successful social relationships.\nMoreover, as Van Boven has observed, young people who pursue happiness through \"things\" are liked less by others than young people who seek happiness through experiences. \nThis research is pretty solid, but I suspect it won't persuade young people not to desire a style. It's natural to want to express yourself through your appearance. So my advice is, create a look that isn't tied to a designer label. \nYou don't have to  _ to send a message about who you are. Take a trip. Go out into the world. Then come back and confidently create your own signature look.",

I would be a different person if my mom hadn't turned a silly bicycle accessory into a life lesson I carry with me today.\nMy mother and father were united in their way of raising children, but it mostly fell to my mother to actually carry it out. Looking back, I honestly don't know how she did it. Managing the family budget must have been a very hard task., but she made it look effortless. If we complained about not having what another kid did, we'd hear something like, \"I don't care what so -and -so got for his birthday, you are not getting a TV in your room a car for your birthday a lsvish sweet 16 party.\" We had to earn our allowance by doing chores around the house. I can stil l remember how long it took to polish the legs of our coffee table.My brothers can no doubt remember hours spent cleaning the house .Like the two little girls growing up at the White House,we made our own beds (no one left the house unitil that was done)and picked up after ourselves.We had to keep track of our belongings ,and if something was lost ,it was not replaced.\nIt was summer and ,one day ,my mother drove me to the bike shop to get a tire fixed---and there it was in the window, White, shiny, plastic and decorated with flowers ,the basket winked at me and I knew ----I knew---I had to have it.\n\"It's beautiful,\" my mother said when I pointed it out to her,\"What a neat basket.\"\nI tried to hold off at first ,I played it cool for a short while. But then I guess I couldn't at and it any longer:\"Mom, please can I please ,please get it? I 'll do extra chores for as long as you say, I'll do anything ,but I need that basket,I love that basket.Please ,Mom .Please?\"\nI was desperate.\n\"You know,\" she said ,gently rubbing my back while we both stared at what I believes was the coolest thing ever,\" If you save up you could buy this yourself.\"\n\"By the time I make enough it'll bu gone!\"\n\"Maybe Roger here could hold it for you,\" she smiled at Roger ,the bike guy.\n\"He can't hold it for that long ,Mom .Someone else will buy it .Please, Mom,Please?\"\n\"There might be another way,\" she said.\nAnd so our paying plan unfolded. My mother bought the beautiful basket and put it safely in some hiding place I couldn't find. Each week I eagerly counted my growing saving increased by extra work here and there (washing the car ,helping my mother make dinner, delivering or collecting things on my bike that already looked _ without the basket in front).And then ,weeks later ,I counted ,re-counted and jumped for joy. Oh ,happy day ! I made it! I finally had the exact amount we'd agreed upon....\nDays later the unthinkable happened. A neighborhood girl I'd played with millions of times appeared with the exact same basket fixed to her shiny ,new bike that already had all the bells and whistles. I rode hard and fast home to tell my mother about this disaster. This horrible turn of events.\nAnd then came the lesson . I've taken with me through my life:\"Honey, Your basket is extra-special,\" Mom said, gently wiping away my hot tears.\"Your basket is special because you paid for it yourself.\"",

Because they tremble at the thought of being seen in public in clothes that are out of fashion, they are always taken advantage of by the designers and the big stores. Clothes which have been worn only a few times have to be put aside because of the change of fashion. When you come to think of it, only a woman is capable of standing in front of a wardrobe packed full of clothes and announcing sadly that she has nothing to wear.\nChanging fashions are nothing more than the intentional creation of waste. Many women spend vast sums of money each year to replace clothes that have hardly been worn. Women who cannot afford to throw away clothing in this way, waste hours of their time altering the dresses they have. Skirts are lengthened or shortened; neck-lines are lowered or raised, and soon.\nNo one can claim that the fashion industry contributes anything really important to society. Fashion designers are rarely concerned with vital things like warmth, comfort and durability. They are only interested in outward appearance and they take advantage of the fact that women will put up with any amount of discomfort, as long as they look right. There can hardly be a man who hasn't at some time in his life smiled at the sight of a woman shaking in a thin dress on a winter day, or delicately picking her way through deep snow in high-heeled shoes.\nWhen comparing men and women in the matter of fashion, _ .

The show takes the ever-common talk show titles of love, sex, cheating, and hate, to a different level. Clearly, the Jerry Springer show is about the dark side of society, yet people are willing to eat up the troubles of other people's lives.\nLike Jerry Springer, Oprah Winfrey takes the TV talk show to its top. But Oprah goes in the opposite direction. The show is mainly about the improvement of society and different quality of life. Contents are from teaching your children lessons, managing your work week, to getting to know your neighbors.\nCompared to Oprah, the Jerry Springer show looks like poisonous waste being poured into society. Jerry ends every show with a \"final word\". He makes a small speech about the entire idea of the show. Hopefully, this is the part where most people will learn something very valuable.\nClean as it is, the Oprah show is not for everyone. The show's main audience are middle-class Americans.

These all became a big part of our life today. The first part of the 20th century saw more great inventions. The helicopter in 1909. Sound movies in 1926. The computer in 1928, and jet planes in 1930. This was also a time when a new material was made. Nylon came out in 1935. It changed the kind of clothes people wear. The middle part of the 20th brought new ways to help people get over diseases. They worked very well. They made people healthier and let them live long lives. By the 1960s most people could expect to live to be at least 60. By this time most people had a very good life. Of course new inventions continued to be made. But man now had a wish to explore again. The world is known to man but the stars are not yet. Man began looking for ways to go into space. Russia made the first step. Then the United States took a step. Since then other countries, including China and Japan, have made their steps into space.",

As Dr. Goodall says, \"What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide what kind of difference you want to make.\"\nIn Bulgaria, where I live, homeless dogs are everywhere. Many people here turn a blind eye to them. But I cannot ignore the life of a street dog whenever I see one wandering in the street, looking for something to eat. That's why I'm no longer a food waster. When I see wasted food, I always think of a hungry dog climbing to garbage bins, searching for food that people have thrown there. When eating in a restaurant, I'm not afraid to take leftover food to feed stray cats or dogs.\nA week ago, I saw a homeless dog around the garbage bins. Immediately I knelt down, spoke to her softly and ran my hands over her. I could see that she had had puppies. I couldn't imagine how she could have been able to care for them. Hours earlier, I'd bagged up a plate of leftover fish. As I unwrapped it, she wagged her tail and sniffed at it. She ate all the fish in no time.\nIt's sad, isn't it? I can't understand why many of us waste so much and think little of it. These homeless animals have taught me that food is precious. Even when I don't have leftovers with me, I'll take the time to get something from the grocery store to feed them.\nI know my power is small, so I hope that next time you see wasted food, do turn it into worthy food.

Edinburgh is faced with the problem of dssposing of about250,000\nMillion tons of waster a year . Despite different ways to dispose of much of it in a green manner---largely through encouraging tecycling---its aging facilities such as the Powderhall landfill do not have the ability to deal with it.\nThe European Union(EU) has issued a new policy, regulating how such mountains of waster are to hr disposed of. The five councils (Edinburgh. East Lothian. West Lothian. Midlethian and Borders) face fine around $18million a year from 2013 it they don't inerease recycling levels and rely less on landfill. With this in mind, the coumlls got together with the idea of building a lage incinerator plant  to burn half of the waste produced in their districts. But the plan fell apart after the change of target levels by a new UK government waste policy which required that no more than 25% of the city's waste should be disposed of in this way by 2025.\nAfter the plan was abandoned, a private company which already transported millions of tons of the city's wast by train to a landfill site near Dunbar, offered an alternative soution when it suggested opening a huge waste site near Portobello.\nSince Powderhall is supposed to close in 2015, it seemed necessary for the members of the Edinburgh Council to accept the suggestion. But soon they turned it down--after 700 local objections reached them--because it would have meant hundreds of lorries a day making loud noise through heavily populated areas.\nThat still leaves eth council with a problem. By 2013,only50%of 1995 levels of waste will benllewed to be sent to landfill. Even if recveling large are met, there will still be a large amount of rubbish to be burnt up.

One person was killed and three injured in the first shooting at Northern Arizona University early on Friday. Later that morning a shooting at a student complex near Texas Southern University left one person dead.\nIn Arizona, police named the gunman there as Steven Jones, an 18-year-old first year student at Northern Arizona University.Mr. Jones told police he was approached by a group of men and attacked. He fled, produced a gun from his pocket and opened fire when the men caught up with him, Arizona police said. Witnesses told police that the victims were unarmed.\nThe second shooting in Texas happened later on Friday morning at the University Courtyard Apartments on the edge of the Houston campus. One student was killed, a freshman at the school, the university confirmed, and another person was wounded. Two people have been arrested as suspects and a third is still at large, said Houston police spokeswoman Jodi Silva.\nThe attacks came as President Barack Obama visited families of victims of a college shooting in Oregon. On arriving in Oregon, he was jeered  by gun rights activists who oppose calls he made for tougher gun laws after nine people were killed at Umpqua Community College, Roseburg, last week.\nAfter a private meeting with families, Mr Obama said he had \"strong feelings\" about gun control, adding: \"We are going to have to come together as a country to see how we can prevent these issues from taking place.\"\nOn the edge of this little American town, a few hundred protestors gathered to tell their president he was not welcome. Many were openly carrying handguns to _ their message. The demonstrators blamed the shooting here last week on two things: a failure to treat mental health problems and the designation of Umpqua Community College as a gun-free zone.

In fact, something far more threatening was at hand, as the Americans were telling Stalin at Potsdam. \nIn 1939 physicists in the United States had learned of experiments in Germany showing the possibility of atomic power and understood the coming damage of an atomic bomb. On August 2, 1939, Albert Einstein warned President Roosevelt of the danger of Nazi Germany's advances in development of the atomic bomb. Eventually, the U.S. Office of Scientific Research Development was created in June 1941 and given combined responsibility with the War Department in the Manhattan Project to develop a nuclear bomb. After four years of research and development efforts, an atomic device was set off on July 16, 1945, in a desert area at Alamogordo, New Mexico, producing an explosive power equal to that of more than 15,000 tons of TNT. Thus, the atomic bomb was born. Truman, the new U.S. president, believed that this terrible object might be used to defeat Japan in a way less costly of U.S. lives than an ordinary invasion of the Japanese homeland. Japan's unsatisfactory reply to the Allies' Potsdam Declaration decided the matter.\nOn August 6, 1945, an atomic bomb, carried from Tinian Island in the Mariana in a specially equipped B-29 was dropped on Hiroshima, at the southern end of Honshu. The combined heat and explosion destroyed everything in the explosion's immediate neighbourhood , produced fires that burned out almost 4.4 square miles completely, and killed between 70,000 and 80,000 people, in addition to injuring more than 70,000 others. A second bomb dropped on Nagasaki on August 9, killed between 35,000 and 40,000 people, injured a like number and ruined 1.8 square miles.",

At a stated time all the citizens would assemble at a town meeting, where they would discuss local problems and express opinions freely. They also elected the town's officials at these gatherings and made decisions about the taxes they would pay and about other community matters. These meetings were usually held at the town hall, which was located in the central square.\nIn the eighteenth-century town meetings, only men who owned property and who were church members actually voted, although everyone present was allowed to express their opinions. Later, all citizens were allowed to vote. Thus the town meeting became truly democratic. Town meetings are still common in New England communities.\nIn recent years the town meeting idea has been widely imitated. There are open sessions of this kind on radio and television. Occasionally a meeting of this type is called by a government agency in order to give an opportunity for free and open discussion on current problems and policies.",

Now, an art show called \"Doctor Strong From Then to Now\" is travelling around the United States. The pictures and drawings show the history of Doctor Strong.\nDoctor Strong first became famous almost fifty years ago when his first children's book was published. Since then, he has written forty-five books that have sold more than one hundred million copies around the world.\nDoctor Strong's books are known for their easy use of words and colorful, hand-drawn pictures. These drawings bring life to his imaginary creatures. The Cat in the Hat, Horton the Elephant, The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, and hundreds of others.\nThe San Diego Museum, in California, organized the art show. It included about three hundred Doctor Strong's original  drawings and some of his writings.\nMost of Doctor Strong's books, although written in a funny way, have serious messages. For example, in Mc Elligot's Pool, he describes the danger of pollution. He discusses the arms race in The Butter Battle Book, written in nineteen eighty-four.\nDoctor Strong is almost eighty-four years old now. He says he never planned to write stories just for children. He says he writes stories that interest people of all ages. He says he uses easy words so that everyone, even a child, can understand.",

        "passage": "Do you want to be a successful person? Would you like to know how successful people usually think and what drives them? Here I am going to tell you the key to success that successful people share.\nFirst of all, successful people never blame someone or something outside of themselves for their failure to move ahead. They realize that their future lies in their own hands. They understand that they can't control things in life, such as nature, the past and other people. At the same time, they are well aware that they can control their own thoughts and actions. They take responsibility for their life.\nPerhaps what most separates successful people from others is that they live life \"on purpose\" --- they are doing what they believe they are put here to do. In their opinion, having a purpose in their life is the most important element that enables them to deal with things around them. They hold the view that when they live their life \"on purpose\", their main concern is to do the job right. They live what they do. People want to do business with them because of their commitment. To live their life \"on purpose\", successful people find a cause they believe in and create a business around it.\nBesides, they never give up easily. Once they have set up goals in their life, they are willing to do whatever it takes to achieve their goals. To achievers always bear in mind what they don't have forever. Rather than see this as negative or depressing, they would use the knowledge to _ themselves on and go after what they want energetically and passionately.\nSo keep in mind what successful people always hold to be true so that you will have a clear idea of what you should do to be successful in life.",

The number of books read was nine books for women and five for men. The number also showed that those with college degrees read the most, and people aged 50 and over read more than those who are younger.\nPeople from the West and Midwest are more likely to have read at least one book in the past year. Southerners who do read tend to read more books -- mostly religious books and romance novels -- than people from other regions.\nThose who said they never attend religious services read nearly twice as many books as those who attend frequently, but the Bible and religious works were read by two thirds of the people in the survey, more than all the other categories. Popular fiction, histories, biographies and mysteries took up about half, while one in five read romance novels. Politics, poetry and classical literature were named by fewer than 5% of readers. More women than men read every major category of books except for history and biography books.

Then a terrible thing happened. The man calmly walked all over the child's body with his heavy boots, and left her screaming on the ground. It was an inhuman thing to do. I ran after the man, caught him and fetched him back. There was already a small crowd around the screaming child. The man was perfectly cool, but he gave me a very evil look, which made me feel sick in my stomach. The child's family then arrived, and also a doctor. The child had been sent to fetch the doctor for a sick neighbor, and was on her way home again.\n'\"The child is more frightened than hurt,\" said the doctor -- and that, you would think, was the end of the story. But, you see, I had taken a violent dislike to the short man. So had the child's family -- that was only natural. But the doctor, who seemed a quiet, kind man, was also looking at our prisoner with murder in his eyes.\n'The doctor and I understood each other perfectly. Together we shouted at the man, and told him we would tell this story all over London so that his name would be hated.\n'He looked back at us with a proud, black look. \"Name your price,\" he said.\n'We made him agree to a hundred pounds for the child's family. With another black look, the man led us to that door over there. He took out a key and let himself into the building. _ he came out and handed us ten pounds in gold and a cheque for ninety pounds from Coutts's Bank. The name on the cheque was a well-known one.\n'\"See here,\" said the doctor doubtfully, \"it isn't usual for a man to walk into an empty house at four in the morning and come out with another man's cheque for nearly a hundred pounds.\"\n'\"Don't worry,\" said the man with an ugly look, \"I'll stay with you until the banks open, and change the cheque myself.\"\n'So we all went off, the doctor and the prisoner and myself, and spent the rest of the night at my house.

William Burk, a pet food specialist from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), believes that feeding raw meat to pets is against its goal of protecting the public from health dangers, and that raw meat and bones do not have all the required nutrition that a pet needs every day.\nRecognizing how popular these foods are, the FDA has provided guidelines for producers of pet foods which contain uncooked meat for dogs, cats and other pets. The guidelines give rules to protect pet owners and pets from dangers about food safety and lack of nutrition.\nPet owners who feed raw meat and bones to their pets should deal with these products very carefully to protect themselves against possible dangers, says Burk.  Just as when you are preparing foods for human beings, use hot water and soap to wash your hands, containers, and surfaces that come into contact with the food. Don't put your hands near your mouth until you have washed them, and don't allow your pet to touch your face right after it has eaten raw meat.\n\"If pet owners choose to feed bones to their pets, they should watch their pets carefully when they are eating bones,\" Burk says. \"If a pet eats a big piece of bone that won't pass through its digestive system , it is likely to kill the pet.\"",

Dogs and cats have been popular Christmas gifts in the gifts in the UK and Europe for many years. But some people still haven't quite got the message.\nThe slogan still holds good. Some 105,000 dogs were _ by local government last year because they had been abandoned, many of them shortly after the festival season.\nThe main reason given by owners for handing their dogs over to the Dogs Trust is that the dogs need more attention than they can give; behavioral problems and moving home are also reasons given.\nBut Eleanor Silk, the Trust's communications director, says, \"It's often four or five months after Christmas, in early summer, when owners find that the dog has got too big and too active, or it hasn't been trained properly and has caused damage around the home.\"\nIn any case, some organizations that help pets are quick to point out that if you are serious about getting a puppy  as a pet, Christmas is not the time to do it. Puppies need to get used to their new surroundings, to be introduced to a routine, and to be looked after like small children. It's hard to meet any of these needs at Christmas. What's more, pulling a puppy out of a Christmas stocking in itself sends the wrong message to children. It encourages children to think of the puppy as a toy, rather than a responsibility.\nAppreciating what you're taking on with a dog can be a sobering   realization. \"For life\" means thinking about the effect they'll have on your life. It also infers you will need to care for the dog for its whole life.",

        "passage": "\"What is the most important thing you've done in your life?\" The question was put to me during a presentation I gave to a group of lawyers.\nThe answer came to me in an instant. It's not the one I gave, because the situation was not right. As a lawyer in the entertainment industry, I knew the audience wanted to hear some amusing stories about my work with well-known people, but here's the true answer:\nThe most important thing I've ever done occurred on October 8,1990. I began the day playing tennis with an old friend I hadn't seen for a while. Between points we talked about what had been happening in each other's lives. He and his wife had just had a baby boy, who was keeping them up at night.\nWhile we were playing, a car came screaming up the road toward the courts. It was my friend's father, who shouted to my friend that his baby had stopped breathing and was being rushed to the hospital. In a flash my friend was in the car and gone, disappearing in a cloud of dust.\nFor a moment I just stood there, paralyzed . Then I tried to figure out what I should do. Follow my friend to the hospital? There was nothing I could accomplish there, I convinced myself. My friend's son was in the care of doctors and nurses, and nothing I could do or say would affect the outcome. Be there for moral support? Well, maybe. But my friend and his wife both had large families, and I knew they'd be surrounded by relatives who would provide more than enough comfort and support, whatever happened. All I could do at the hospital, I decided, was to get in the way. Also, I had planned a full day with my family, who were waiting for me to get home. So I decided to head back to my house and check in my friend later.\nAs I started my car, I realized that my friend had left his truck and keys at the courts. I now faced another problem. I couldn't leave the keys in the truck. So I decided to go to the hospital and give him the keys.\nWhen I arrived, I was directed to a room where my friend and his wife were waiting. As I had thought, the room was filled with family members silently watching my friend comfort his wife. I went in and stood by the door, trying to decide what to do next. Soon a doctor appeared. He approached my friend and his wife, and in a quiet voice told them that their son had died.\nFor a long time the two held each other and cried, unaware of the rest of us standing around in pained silence. After they had calmed themselves, the doctor suggested they spend a few moments with their son.\nMy friend and his wife stood up and walked past their families. When they reached the door, my friend saw me standing in the corner. He came over and hugged me and started to cry. My friend's wife hugged me, too, and said , \"Thanks for being here.\"\nFor the rest of that morning, I sat in the emergency room of that hospital and watched my friend and his wife hold the body of their infant son, and say goodbye.\nIt's the most important thing I have ever done. The experience taught me two lessons.\nFirst: The most important thing I've ever done happened when I was completely helpless. None of the things I had learned in university, in three years of law school or in six years of legal practice were of any use in that situation. Something terrible was happening to people I cared about, and I was powerless to change the outcome. All I could do was standing by and watching it happen. And yet it was critical that I do just that--- just be there when someone needed me.\nSecond: The most important thing I've done almost didn't happen because of things I had learned in classroom and professional life. Law school taught me how to take a set of facts, break them down and organized them. These skills are critical for lawyers. When people come to us for help, they're often stressed out and depend on a lawyer to think logically. But while learning to think, I almost forget how to feel. Today I have no doubt that I should have leapt into my car without hesitation and followed my friend to the hospital.\nFrom that one experience I learned that the most important thing in life isn't the money you make, the status you attain or the honors you achieve.",

And many teenagers find that earning their own money gives them a sense of pride and freedom.\nThe US Department of Labor allows teenagers to apply for jobs at the age of 14. Popular part-time jobs include working in ice cream stores, coffee shops, and clothing stores. During the school year, teenagers may go to work a few times a week after their classes get out, then work for longer on the weekends.\nIn the summer, top jobs for teens include working at camps, swimming pools and amusement parks. These jobs are great for young people who want to be active and have fun while making money.\nA favorite job for many teens is babysitting , and they can start before 14 if the parents agree. After the children are sleeping and before the parents come home, babysitters have lots of freedom.\nAs long as they stay in the house and make sure the kids are okay, babysitters can do their homework, enjoy a snack, watch TV, or talk on the phone with friends.\nIt can be stressful to balance school, homework, and a part-time job.

Human brains differ considerably, some being more capable than others. But no matter how good a brain he has to begin with, an individual will have a low order of intelligence unless he has opportunities to learn. So the second factor is what happens to the individual--the sort of environment in which he is reared  . If an individual is handicapped   environmentally, it is likely that his brain will fail to develop and he will never attain the level of intelligence of which he is capable.\nThe importance of environment in determining an individual's intelligence can be demonstrated by the case history of the identical twins, Peter and Mark X. Being identical, the twins had identical brains at birth, and their growth processes were the same. When the twins were three months old, their parents died, and they were placed in separate foster homes. Peter was reared by parents of low intelligence in an isolated community with poor educational opportunities. Mark was reared in the home of well-to-do parents who had been to college. He was read to as a child, sent to good schools, and given every opportunity to be stimulated intellectually. This environmental difference continued until the twins were in their late teens, when they were given tests to measure their intelligence. Mark's I.Q. was 125, twenty-five points higher than the average and fully forty points higher than his identical brother. Given equal opportunities, the twins, having identical brains, would have tested at roughly the same level.",

At that time Yangzhou was a famous port and one of few biggest cities in East Asia.\nWith the improvement of the local economy and easy transportation way, there happened in the history a special local culture, which has an important place in Chinese culture.

Zheng Banqiao, a famous Chinese painting painter in the Qing Dynasty heading a group called \"Eight Eccentrics\", had strongly influenced Chinese paintings. Wang Zhong and Yuan Yuan and some other scholars formed school of Yangzhou Scholars and achieved great success in the study of classic Chinese and writing. Zhu Ziqing, one of most famous modern Chinese writers and scholars, had always been proud of himself as a native of Yangzhou and thanked the city for being nourished  by its rich culture. Quite a few other names you may come across frequently in the study of Chinese culture and history have connection with Yangzhou . Yangzhou was so attractive and important that many Chinese emperors in history had come specially to visit or check the city.

We often convince ourselves future will be better than today. John Lennon once said, \"Life is what's happening while we're busy making other plans. \"When we're busy making other plans\", our children are busy growing up, the people we love are moving away and dying, our bodies are getting out of shape, and our dreams are slipping away.

Now is the only time we have, and the only time that we have any control over. When our attention is in the present moment, we push fear from our minds. Fear is the concern over events that might happen in the future--we won't have enough money, our children will get into trouble, we will get old and die, whatever. \nTo struggle against fear, the best strategy is to learn to bring your attention back to the present.

Nancy's pace got slower and slower because she felt a great pain in her head. Finally, all she could do was to throw her arm around Lizzie's neck and try to hang on. About 20 minutes later, Lizzie managed to pull herself and Nancy out of the rising water and onto a bit of high land, which seemed like a small island in the middle of a lake of white water. \nEven though it was about noon, the sky was so dark and the rain and lightning was so bad that it took rescuers more than two hours to discover Nancy. A man from a helicopter  lowered a rope, but Nancy couldn't catch it. A moment later, two men landed on the small island from a ladder in the helicopter. They raised her into the helicopter and took her to the school gym, where the Red Cross had set up an emergency shelter. \nWhen the flood disappeared two days later, Nancy immediately went back to the \"island.\" Lizzie was gone.

Ceilings. For the 10 years I've known her I had never suspected that she was this passionate about stained glass.\nStill one of the best things about such pictures -- despite their obvious narrow appeal -- is that they can't help but tell us a great deal about the people who took them.\nSo I shouldn't have been surprised when I got the roll of film back from my 5-year-old son's first camping trip. I opened the envelope, naively expecting to see pictures of the nightly campfire, the sun setting over the forest, and possibly even a deer or two.\nInstead, I saw an off-center picture of tennis shoes. Not even his tennis shoes, mind you, but a pair someone had lost and left in the cabin. Mystery shoes. And that's not all.\nAs I went through the stack, I found that my son had also taken a picture of his sleeping bag, a penny he found in the gravel next to the car, a leaf, an orange sock, a close-up of his father's ear, a burned hot dog, his thumb, a piece of gum, and many other similar things.\nThere was barely one sign of nature in the whole stack. I couldn't help thinking that if he'd wanted pictures of assorted junk, it would've been cheaper had he spent the weekend in our back-yard.\nAT LEAST that is what I thought until I showed the photographs to my ceiling-snapping friend, the mother of three teenagers, who said simply, \"There's nothing wrong with these.\"\nBut of course, this is just the type of answer you'd expect from someone who photographs ceiling.\nThen she told me about the time her daughter went to Yosemite Valley and returned with rolls of photographs of the hotel, restaurant, and gift shop. She also told me about the time her son took his camera to a Major League Baseball game and returned with 24 pictures of cloud formations.\nI had a feeling she was just trying to make me feel better.\nThen again, to a 5-year-old boy, finding a penny is more exciting than seeing a squirrel. And why would he waste good film on something like, say, some endangered water buffaloes, when he could take a picture of cool tennis shoes? Or his shiny new green sleeping bag?\nFace it: Things like beautiful sunsets and campfires can't compare to a bag of extra-large marshmallow.\nSo I did what any good mother would do: I marked the date on the back of the pictures and slid them into our family vacation photo album -- right after the five pages of ice sculptures I took last year on our cruise to the Bahamas.",

        "passage": "Science Daily (Apr. 27, 2008)-- Dutch ecologist Roxina Soler and her colleagues have discovered that subterranean   and aboveground herbivorous   insects can communicate with each other by using plants as telephones.  Subterranean insects issue chemical warning signals through the leaves of the plant. This way, aboveground insects are warned that the plant is already \"occupied\".\n     Aboveground, leaf-eating insects prefer plants that have not yet been occupied by subterranean root-eating insects. Subterranean insects send out chemical signals through the leaves of the plant, which warn the aboveground insects about their presence. This messaging makes it possible for spatially-separated insects to avoid each other, so that they do not compete for, the same plant.\n     In recent years it has been discovered that different types of aboveground insects develop slowly if they feed on plants that also have subterranean insects and 'vice versa  . It seems that a mechanism   has developed through natural selection,  which helps the subterranean and aboveground insects to communicate with each other. This avoids unnecessary competition.\n      Through the \"green telephone lines\", subterranean insects can also communicate with     _ , namely the natural enemy of caterpillars  . Parasitic wasps   lay their eggs inside aboveground insects. The wasps also benefit from the signals sent by the leaves, as these help them find more insects for their eggs.\n     The communication between subterranean and above- ground insects has only been studied in a few systems. It is still not clear how widespread this phenomenon is, say the researchers.",

While the sport has not _ in North America, it is very fashionable in Europe and even Japan.\nPlayed in an indoor court, cycle ball is similar to soccer in many ways--the aim is to score as many goals as possible, and only the goalkeeper is allowed to touch the ball.\nThe one big difference? Use of legs is forbidden. Instead, players have to guide the ball across the court, using the front wheels of their bicycles or with their heads. In fact, if a player even touches the floor with his feet during the 14-minute game, it is considered a foul  and the opposing team gets a free kick.\nWhile the game was initially  played with normal bikes, things are a little different now. The seats of these specialized bikes are positioned over the back tire and they sport a single fixed gear, making it easier for the rider to control the constant back and forth movement required for the game. The handlebars  also point straight up so that the competitors can sit upright while playing and they are about twice the weight of normal bikes, which helps with the stability.\nWhile cycle ball may sound a little strange, it is a fast-paced sport that requires much training, skill, and, is also really fun to watch.",

Now this is not considered cool in town and the word \"train-spotter\" in Britain is related to \"geek\" or \"nerd\" (someone who seems very ridiculous). But is this reputation really deserved?\nFirst of all, let's see what train-spotting is. It is said that there are some 100,000 train spotters in the UK. Exactly as the title suggests, they spot trains, that is, they stand in train stations, look at the number of each train that leaves and arrives and write it down. The eventual aim is to have seen every train in the country.\nBeing crazy about railways and trains is not modern and it dates back to 1804. As the number of trains grew and they got faster and faster, so did the interest in them grow? Is this any stranger than people who love cars?\nSo, what do you need to be a train-spotter? Well, all you really need is a pen or pencil and a notebook to write down the train numbers. Other equipment  includes hot tea in a thermos, a camera and some sandwiches for those long afternoons spent on train platforms when you don't want to risk the delights of railway station food.\nIt's interesting to note that despite the \"bad name\" of train-spotting, there have been famous railway lovers in history, such as Alfred Hitchcock, who filmed them regularly, especially The 39 Steps. There is evidence, too, that being a train-spotter is not necessarily a strange phenomenon in Britain.\nOne glance at the US train stations should be enough to convince you that train-spotters there are alive and well. In America, they try to call rail lovers \"train-fans\" and talk of \"train-fanning\". Don't let this fool you--these people are train spotters and there are a lot of them.

They will teach you some of the most important lessons about who you are. This may help you understand different kinds of relationships, what makes each relationship special, and how to communicate in a positive way. \n    What makes a relationship healthy?\n    Communication and Sharing: The most important part of any healthy relationship between two people is being able to talk and listen to each other. You and the other person can find out what your common interests are. You can share your feelings with the other person and trust that he or she will be there to listen to you and support you. In healthy relationships, people don't lie. Communication is based on honesty and trust. By listening carefully and sharing your thoughts and feelings with other people, you show them that they play an important part in your life.\n    Respect and Trust: In healthy relationships, you learn to respect and trust important people in your life. Disagreements may still happen, but you learn to stay calm and talk about how you feel. Talking calmly helps you to understand the real reason for not getting along. It makes it much easier to figure out how to fix it. In healthy relationships, working through disagreements often makes the relationship stronger. In healthy relationships, people respect each other for who they are. This includes respecting and listening to yourself and your feelings so you can set boundaries and feel comfortable. You will find that you learn to understand experiences and feelings of others as well as having them understand your experiences and feelings.\n    How do I know that I have a healthy relationship with someone?\n    You know that you are in a healthy relationship with someone because you feel good about yourself when you are around that person. Unhealthy relationships can make you feel sad, angry, scared, or worried.\n    Healthy peer relationships involve an equal amount of giving and taking in the relationship. In unhealthy relationships, there is an unfair balance. You may often feel that you are giving the other person more attention than that he or she gives to you.\n    You should feel safe around the other person and feel that you can trust him or her with your secrets.  In a healthy relationship, you like to spend time with the other person, instead of feeling that you have to spend time with him or her.",

The reason for the surprising decision by the Los Angeles Lakers super guard last week has become a hot topic for debate. \nBryant wore No.24 when he was in early high school, but he changed to No.33 in his senior year. He switched to No.8 when he was selected by the Lakers in 1996, and has been not changed since. \nBryant has refused to explain the decision until the end of the play-offs. So guessing Bryant's motive has become a popular game among NBA fans and newspaper columnists. \nThere are all kinds of speculations . Many say that Bryant wants to leave the past behind and have a fresh start. He has often been criticized for playing to benefit himself and not the team as a whole. Others say that he may be trying to compare himself to Michael Jordan. prefix = st1 /Jordanwas famous for his No. 23 jersey . Some, such as NBC Sport columnist Michael Ventre, argue that it is \"all about money\". Bryant will make more money by selling new jerseyto his fans. \nSome speculations are more about fun. For example, there is an opinion that Kobeis actually just a diehard fan of the popular TV drama \"24\". \nAll this talk has turned the number change into a major issue. It seems that there is a lot of fuss over something that should be pretty simple. \nJersey numbers have their own special significance in American sports, especially basketball. Players choose their number when they join a team and they usually stick with that number for the rest of their career. When a great player retires, his team will honor him by retiring his number.",

Yet he was too proud to accept anything from the people in the village. \nOnce, these veterans held a reunion dinner in the home of Jules Grandin, who had made a good deal of money. Grandin produced a curiosity --a large old gold coin. Each man examined it with interest as it passed around the long table. All, however, had drunk wine freely and the room was full of noisy talk, so that the gold piece was soon forgotten. Later, when Grandin remembered it and asked for it, the coin was missing.\nOne of them suggested everyone be searched, to which all agreed, except Blustering. \"You refuse, then?\" asked Grandin. Blustering said with a red face, \"Yes, I cannot allow it.\"\nOne by one, the others turned out their pockets. When the coin failed to appear, attention was focused on poor Blustering. Under the pitying stares of his friends, he walked out and returned to his home.\nA few years later, Grandin made his house repaired. A workman found the gold coin, buried in dirt between planks   of the floor. Hurrying to Blustering's home, Grandin apologized to him. \n\"But why didn't you allow yourself be searched?\"\n\"Because I was a thief,\" Blustering said brokenly. \"For weeks we had not had enough to eat and my pockets were full of food that I had taken from the table to carry home to my wife and hungry children.\"",

However, it's when I realized that I would never have to spend another holiday alone and that was truly an amazing feeling.\nI was always eager to spend time with my little sister, Beth. She was six when I joined the family. My dad always says he knew we were really sisters, and I was no longer a guest in the house when Beth and I had our first fight. Today, she's one of my best friends, and I'm her biggest cheerleader.\nThere were also bittersweet Thanksgivings. One we spent in my mom's hospital room. It was there that she helped me plan my wedding but passed away three weeks before the ceremony. My dad walked me down the aisle, and my sister was my maid of honor. Because of our bond, we were able to support each other through that challenging time and that's what family is for--the good and bad times.\nIt's nice having my dad and sister to share holidays and special occasions. But they're even more important when it comes to the little things--like having someone to share my bad day with, celebrate my promotion at work, or help me think through a difficult decision. It's in these moments that I just can't imagine being alone in the world.\nI'm so glad that I didn't listen to those people who said I was unadoptable, I'd never find a family, and that I was putting myself out there for rejection. It's a risk for older foster youth to consider adoption. _ But it's a risk they should take because life doesn't end at 18. It's really just beginning.\nIf you know someone who might consider adopting an older teen, please share my story -- and have him or her think of my family. They didn't get to see my first steps or watch me be a pilgrim in my second grade Thanksgiving play. But they taught me so many things about life, and were there to watch me walk across the stage when I graduated from college and law school and accompanied me to the White House last year as I was honored for my work helping foster youth.\nI look forward to many more Thanksgivings with my family, and I'm eternally thankful they chose me to be a part of their family.",

How can you help yourself learn a new language, such as English? There are several ways to make learning English a little easier and more interesting.\nThe first step is to feel confident about learning English. If you believe that you can learn, you will learn. Be patient. You don't have to understand everything all at once. It is natural to make mistakes when you learn something new. We can learn from our mistakes.\nThe second step is to practise your English. For example,write in a diary every day. You will get used to writing in English,and you will feel comfortable expressing your ideas in English. After several weeks, you will see that your writing is improving. Besides, you must speak English every day. You can practise with your classmates after class. You will all make mistakes, but gradually you will become comfortable _ in English.\nThe third step is to keep a record of your language learning. You can write this in your diary. After each class, think about what you did. Did you answer a question correctly? Did you understand anything the teacher explained? Perhaps the lesson was difficult, but you tried to understand it. Write these achievements  in your diary.\nYou must be active in learning English and believe that you can do it. It is important to practise every day and make a record of your achievements.

She threw the man, who was heavier and stronger than she was, over her head. Then she held him tightly on the ground. How? She knew Judo.\nJiu-jitsu, as judo is sometimes called, means \"muscle science\" in Japanese. The student of judo needs to learn a lot about the body, its bones and muscles. Judo uses a number of \"falls\", \"holds\" and \"throws\". Someone who does not know judo cannot defend himself against them. If you know judo you can defend yourself against a person who is stronger than you. You had better not practice judo on your friends unless they can fall without hurting themselves! Being strong is one thing, but using the body wisely is another. In judo, you use the other person's body to help you. You \"throw\" him to the ground and \"hold\" him there, so that he cannot move.

Runners call it \"hitting the wall\"; I thought I couldn't move another muscle. Out of nowhere, a teenager jogged up next to me and said, \"What's your name sweetie? Jennifer? Okay, Jennifer, let's go! Come on! It's just around the corner! You can do it!\". And he ran with me until I picked up my pace.

        "passage": "The college entrance exam is not only a big challenge   for Chinese high school students, but also a very important exam in the lives of South Korean students.\nAlthough the long, cold winter has already started in South Korea, the annual   national exams have made the atmosphere very heated.\nMore than 675,000 South Korean high school graduates took the college entrance exam last Wednesday. They usually take exams in Korean, maths, sociology  , history and foreign languages.\nOfficially there is one college place for every 1.33 students. But because all the students want to go to the top universities in the country, the competition can reach one place for 10 students. The students want to attend these colleges for both their famous names and better job opportunities.\nBecause students face fierce competition, they have to study very hard to realize their dreams. Park Seung said he and his classmates often go to school before 7:30 a.m. After school has finished at 6:30 p.m., most of them go to the library to continue their study instead of returning home. Since many libraries in South Korea are open 24 hours a day, they often stay long into the night. Many of the Senior 3 students only sleep for three to four hours a day. \"I feel a lot of pressure, but I have to study very hard in order to make my dream come true. This is my lifetime goal and it will be a turning point in my life which could decide my future,\" Park said.\nThe exam day is a very serious day for the whole of South Korea. Vehicles are not allowed within a 200-metre radius   of all the test sites to make sure the students have quiet surroundings. Tooting   of horns is forbidden, even airplanes are ordered to avoid landing and take-off near the test sites during listening comprehension test hours.\nStudents are told their scores in December before they apply for college. This is followed by face-to-face oral tests. There are public and private universities in South Korea. Many private universities are well-known, but their fees can be 18, 000 yuan each term. This has made a lot of students think again.",

The lighthouse is amazing at sunset (and it is the most easterly part of mainland Australia). There are a range of music festivals over the year that attract international and local musicians alike.\nThe Great Ocean Road\nThe Great Ocean Road, located in Victoria, is one of the best scenic drives of the world. Its official length is 243 kms (roughly 150 miles), but it will take you a full day to enjoy it due to the narrow and windy traffic lanes (only one in each direction).\nDaintree Rainforest\nLocated in northern Queensland, roughly 110 kms north of Cairns, the rainforest is a nature wonderland. It is Australia's largest rainforest, about 20% of Australia's native bird species can be found within the Daintree.\nThe Great Barrier Reef\nLocated in Queensland, this attraction is one of those attractions that are actually known by everyone.

He looked at it, and all joy left him. The fence was long and high. He put the brush into the whitewash and moved it along the top of the fence. He repeated the operation. He felt he could not continue and sat down.\nHe knew that his friends would arrive soon with all kinds of interesting plans for the day. They would walk past him and laugh. They would make jokes about his having to work on a beautiful summer Saturday. The thought burned him like fire.\nHe put his hand into his pockets and took out all that he owned. Perhaps he could find some way to pay someone to do the whitewashing for him. But there was nothing of value in his pockets --nothing that could buy even half an hour of freedom. So he put the bits of toys back into his pockets and gave up the idea\nAt this dark and hopeless moment, a wonderful idea came to him. It filled his mind with a great, bright light. Calmly he picked up the brush and started again to whitewash.\nWhile Tom was working, Ben Rogers appeared. Ben was eating an apple as he walked along the street. As he walked along, he was making noises like the sound of a riverboat. First he shouted loudly, like a boat captain. Then he said \"Ding-Dong-Dong\", \"Ding-Dong-Dong\" again and again, like the bell of a riverboat. And he made other strange noises. When he came close to Tom, he stopped.\nTom went on whitewashing. He did not look at Ben. Ben stared a moment and then said: \"Hello! I'm going swimming, but you can't go, can you?\"\nNo answer. Tom moved his brush carefully along the fence and looked at the result with the eye of an artist. Ben came nearer. Tom's mouth watered for the apple, but he kept on working.\nBen said, \"Hello, old fellow, you've got to work, hey?\"\nTom turned suddenly and said, \"Why, it's you, Ben! I wasn't noticing.\"\n\"Say --I'm going swimming. Don't you wish you could? But of course you'd rather work -- wouldn't you? Of course you would.\"\nTom looked at the boy a bit, and said \"What do you call work?\"\n\"Why, isn't that work?\"\nTom went back to his whitewashing, and answered carelessly.\n\"Well, maybe it is, and maybe it isn't. All I know is, it suits Tom Sawyer.\"\n\"Oh come, now, you don't mean to say that you like it?\"\nThe brush continued to move.\n\"Like it? Well, I don't see why I shouldn't like it. Does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?\"\nBen stopped eating his apple. Tom moved his brush back and forth, stepped back to look at the result, added a touch here and there, and stepped back again. Ben watched every move and got more and more interested. Soon he said,\n\"Say, Tom, let me whitewash a little.\"\nTom thought for a moment, was about to agree; but he changed his mind.\n\"No --no --it won't do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly wants this fence to be perfect. It has got to be done very carefully. I don't think there is one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it well enough.\"\n\"No --is that so? Oh come, now --let me just try. Only just a little.\" \"Ben, I'd like to, but if it isn't done right, I'm afraid Aunt Polly ... \"\n\"Oh, I'll be careful. Now let me try. Say --I'll give you the core of my apple.\"\n\"Well, here --No, Ben, now don't. I'm afraid ...\"\n\"I'll give you all of it.\"\nTom gave up the brush with unwillingness on his face, but joy in his heart. And while Ben worked at the fence in the hot sun, Tom sat under a tree, eating the apple, and planning how to get more help. There were enough boys. Each one came to laugh, but remained to whitewash. By the time Ben was tired, Tom sold the next chance to Billy for a kite; and when Billy was tired, Johnny bought in for a dead rat --and so on, hour after hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, Tom had won many treasures.\nAnd he had not worked. He had had a nice idle time all the time, with plenty of company -and the fence had been whitewashed three times. If he hadn't run out of whitewash, Tom would have owned everything belonging to his friends.\nHe had discovered a great law of human action, namely, that in order to make a man or a boy want a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to get.",

But, it could be _ Sometimes the rainy season can come a month earlier or later. It can be prolonged even more than 4 months and so can the dry season. Even during the dry season, rain can occur several times in certain areas.\nThe prolonged dry season in tropical areas usually causes a lot of losses. It will be very harmful to local farmers, because most of the tropical areas sre regions of the developing countries. Sometimes agricultural and plantation crops will be damaged because of so much dry land and the fact that the river used to flow the water for rice fields are also dry. Rain is very important for plants because rain contains many nutrients that plants are in great need of.\nWhat's more, if the prolonged rainy season arrives and then floods usually occur in certain areas of low lands. Even for the capital city of Jakarta floods have struck several times during the prolonged rainy season. In addition to floods, the rainy season can cause many diseases. During the dry season, diseases are usually caused by mosquitoes such as dengue fever. While in the rainy season, people who have the weak immune will be more easily attacked by some diseases such as flu, fever, diarrhea, and much more.\nIf you live in the other places and want to travel to the tropical regions, make sure that you have known much about the season and the effect for these months in which you want to travel as tourists.

So, you can imagine that I was unprepared for the outpouring of public grief  at a Chinese funeral.\nMy editorial team leader died recently after a short illness. He was 31. The news was so unexpected that it left us all shocked and upset. A female colleague burst into tears and cried piteously at her desk. Somehow we got through the day's work. The next day was the funeral.\nOur big boss stepped forward to deliver a eulogy and was soon in tears. She carried on, in Chinese of course, but at the end said in English: \"There will be no more deadlines for you in heaven.\" Next came a long-term colleague who also dissolved in tears but carried on with her speech despite being almost overcome by emotion. Then a close friend of the dead man paid tribute , weeping openly as he spoke. Sorrow is spreading. Me and women were now sobbing uncontrollably. Finally, the man's mother, supported between two women, addressed her son in his coffin. At one point, the mother almost collapsed and had to be held up. We were invited to step forward to each lay a white rose on the casket. Our dead colleague looked as if he was taking a nap. At the end of the service I walked away from the funeral parlor stunned at the outpouring of emotion.\nIn the UK, families grieve privately and then try to hold it together and not break down at a funeral. Here in China it would seem that grieving is a public affair. It strikes me that it is more cathartic to cry your eyes out than try to keep it bottled up for fear of embarrassment, which is what many of us do in the West.\nAfterwards, a Chinese colleague told me that the lamenting at the funeral had been restrained  by Chinese standards. In some rural areas, she said, people used to be paid to mourn noisily. This struck me like something out of novel by Charles Dickens. But we have all seen on TV scenes of grief-stricken people in Gaza and the West Bank, in Afghanistan, Iraq and the relatives of victims of terrorist bombings around the world. Chinese grief is no different. I realized that it's the reserved British way of mourning that is out of step with the rest of the world.\nIt was our newspaper's production day. We were bussed back to the office to resume work. No more deadlines for our former colleague, but we had to pull together to put the newspaper to print. The boss invited the team to go out for dinner after work. We relaxed, smiled, joked. There was no mention of the funeral or our poor colleague. Enough sorrow had been shed already.

According to the modern legend, he is a magical figure who visits all the children of the world during the night before Christmas Day, leaving presents which they find the next morning. He flies through the night sky in a sledge pulled by reindeer, and enters houses by climbing down chimneys. This strange legend is based on the life of a man called Nicholas, but in fact we know very little about him. Historians think he was a Christian bishop in Turkey in about 285--350 A.D. One of the stories about him is that he helped three poor girls. No one would marry them because they were so poor. To provide them with money for their weddings, Nicholas secretly dropped some gold coins down the chimney of their house. After Nicholas died, he was made a saint  by the church.(The name Santa Claus thus comes from St Nicholas.) His feast day was celebrated in December, and parents started giving their children secret presents from St Nicholas. Over the years, this custom became part of our Christmas traditions.\nRecently, a psychologist has claimed that Father Christmas is \"the perfect fantasy\" for children. According to Professor Anthony Clare, children love the character of Father Christmas because he is like an ideal father: he loves children and gives them presents, but he never criticizes them, is never angry, and children do not even need to thank him for the presents. Other writers, however, point out that Father Christmas can be a frightening character to some children. Jane Bidder says that some children are terrified of this fat, bearded old man. It can certainly confuse many children. As parents, we warn our children to be careful of strangers and never to let them into the house, and yet we tell children that a strange man will come into their bedroom at night! Some children can become very worried about this idea and fear that he is a kind of burglar.\nMost children, however, understand from their parents and from the media that Father Christmas is basically a _ character, and look forward to his annual visit with joy and excitement.",

        "passage": "When his book Little Princes begins, Conor Grennan is planning a year-long trip around the globe, a journey that began with a three-month volunteer service at the Little Princes Children's home, an orphanage  in Nepal.\n              When he arrived at the orphanage, Conor was immediately welcomed by all the children even though he had no previous experience in working with children. He quickly grew to love the job. But it wasn't long before Conor came to learn that the children were not orphans at all -- they were actually children who had been separated from their parents by a child trafficker .\n              This realization turned Conor's global journey into a strong desire to try to find a way to reunite these children with their families. As a part of his efforts, Conor did a great amount of work when he was back in America. He started up a nonprofit organization called Next Generation Nepal(NGN), raising funds in order to buy a house in Nepal for another children's home. Then, back in Nepal, he began a life-changing trek  into the remote villages in the mountains of Humia.\n              It is really amazing to read about Conor communicating with the children and to read his descriptions of each of them. He made me truly care about the kids. I wanted them to be able to reunite with their families, too! Unfortunately, this was simply not possible for some of the children. But there were some children who received amazing surprises. Jagrit, for example, had thought for years that both his parents were dead. So, Conor was dumbfounded when he visited Jagrit's village and was introduced to the boy's father!\n              Conor successfully found many of the families of the children. Also, he was successful in finding his future wife while in Nepal.",

Ulifeline. org), a Web site where students can get answers to questions about depression by logging on through their universities. The site has been adopted as a resource by over 120 colleges, which can customize it with local information, and over 1.3 million students have logged on with their college ID's.\n\"It is a very solid Web site that raises awareness of suicide, de-stigmatizes mental illness and encourages people to seek the help they need,\"said Paul Grayson, the director of counseling services at New York University, which started using the service nearly a year ago.\nThe main component of the Web site is the Self-screening program developed by Duke University Medical Center that tests students to determine whether they are at risk for depression, suicide and disorders like anorexia and drug dependences. Besides helping students, the services compiles anonymous student date, offering administrators an important window onto the mental health of its campus.\nThe site provides university users with links to local mental health services, a catalog of information on prescription drugs and side effects, and access to Go Ask Alice, a vast archive developed by Columbia University with hundreds of responses to anonymously posted inquires from college students worldwide. For students concerned about their friends, there is a section that describes warning signs for suicidal behavior and depression.\nYet it is hard to determine how effective the service is. The anonymity of the online service can even play out as a negative. \"There is no substitute for personal interaction ,\" said Dr. Lanny Berman, executive director of the American Association of Suicidology, based in Washington.\n _ \"The purpose is to find out if there are signs of depression and then direct people to the right places,\" said Ron Gibori, executive director of Ulifeline.\nMrs. Satow, who is still involved with Ulifeline, called it \"a knowledge base\" that might have prevented the death of her son, Jed. \"If Jed's friends had known the signs of depression, they might have seen something,\" she said.",

Actually, most people experience nervousness at some time or another.\nIf you are feeling anxious, my advice is to first find the cause or causes. Make a list of those things that are making you nervous and work out which ones you can do something about. Focus all of your efforts on managing the causes that you can control.\nMost people cannot tell the difference between controllable  and uncontrollable causes, so things they can't control become a big reason for nervousness. Dealing with this is very important if people want to keep a healthy mind.\nSimply try to accept the uncontrollable causes of nervousness. You might be worried about the weather on a big day, an accident or an attack on the train, or perhaps just things that other people are doing at work. The results may be very important but there is still no use worrying because you can't control any of these things. Accept that you can't control everything. Once you understand this, it becomes easier not to worry.\nIf a situation, such as swimming, is causing you to be anxious, try to face it as often as possible so that you can get used to it.\nIt can often help to think about yourself doing the thing that makes you nervous--then close your eyes and imagine it going well. Imagine how the flight or job interview is going to happen so that you can get used to it. This will help you understand that the thing you fear most is probably not going to happen.",

Consider the split-second calculations  you make when you estimate   the number of empty seats on the school bus or the number of cookies in a cookie jar.\nThese estimates can often be done without counting. That's because humans are born with the ability to closely guess the number of items in a group. Researchers call this ability a person's \"number sense\".\nTo see how a person's inborn number sense might be linked to mathematical performance in the classroom, psychologist Justin Halberda and his colleagues from Johns Hopkins University in prefix = st1 /Baltimore,USran some tests.\nThe scientists asked 64 14-year-olds to look at images   of yellow and blue dots that flashed on a computer screen for a fraction   of a second. Each image contained between 10 and 32 dots that varied in size.\nSome images contained twice as many blue dots  as yellow dots. In other images, however, the number of blue and yellow dots was nearly equal. For each image, the students were asked to estimate which color1 had more dots.\nThe scientists found a wide variation in how well students could pick the color1 with the most dots.\nThe scientists then looked at the students' math scores dating back to kindergarten. Children that performed best in the image test also scored the highest in standard math tests.\nThe same finding held true at the other end of the spectrum  . Students who didn't score well on the image test received lower math scores.\nThe study was the first to show a link between a person's inborn number sense and his or her achievement in formal math training.\nDoes this connection mean that one cannot be good in math if they have a weak number sense? Or that having a strong number sense is a guarantee for good grades in math? The answers are not clear.\nWhile scientists continue looking at the possible links between a person's number sense and math achievement, one thing is certain: Doing lots of math homework will   _ your chances of success.",

        "passage": "John Blanchard stood up from the bench, straightened his Army uniform, and studied the crowd of people making their way through Grand Central Station. He looked for the girl whose heart he knew, but whose face he didn't, the girl with the rose.\nHis interest in her had begun thirteen months before in a Florida library. Taking a book off the shelf he found himself intrigued, not with the words of the book, but with the notes penciled in the margin. The soft handwriting reflected a thoughtful soul and insightful mind. In the front of the book, he discovered the previous owner's name, Miss Hollis Maynell. With time and effort he located her address. She lived in New York City. He wrote her a letter introducing himself and inviting her to correspond. The next day he was shipped overseas for service in World War II.\nDuring the next year and one month the two grew to know each other through the mail. Each letter was a seed falling on a fertile heart. A romance was starting Blanchard requested a photograph, but she refused. She felt that if he really cared, it wouldn't matter what she looked like.\nWhen the day finally came for him to return from Europe, they scheduled their first meeting --7:00 PM at the Grand Central Station in New York. \"You'll recognize me,\" she wrote, \"by the red rose I'll be wearing on my lapel.\" So at 7:00 he was in the station looking for a girl whose heart he loved, but whose face he'd never seen.\nI'll let Mr. Blanchard tell you what happened: A young woman was coming toward me, her figure long and slim. Her blonde hair lay back in curls from her delicate ears; her eyes were blue as flowers. Her lips and chin had a gentle firmness, and in her pale green suit she was like springtime come alive. I stared at her, entirely forgetting to notice that she was not wearing a rose. As I moved, a small, attractive smile curved her lips. \"Going my way , sailor?\" she murmured.\nAlmost uncontrollably I made one step closer to her, and then I saw Hollis Maynell. She was standing almost directly behind the girl. A woman well past 40, she had graying hair tucked under a worn hat. She was more than plump, her thick-ankled feet thrust into low-heeled shoes. The girl in the green suit was walking quickly away. I felt as though I was split in two, so keen was my desire to follow her, and yet so deep was my longing for the woman whose spirit had truly companioned me and upheld my own.\nAnd there she stood. Her pale, plump face was gentle and sensible, her gray eyes had a warm and kindly twinkle. I did not hesitate. My fingers gripped the small worn blue leather copy of the book that was to identify me to her.\nThis would not be love, but it would be something precious, something perhaps even better than love, a friendship for which I had been and must ever be grateful. I squared my shoulders and saluted and held out the book to the woman, even though while I spoke I felt choked by the bitterness of my disappointment.  \"I'm Lieutenant John Blanchard, and you must be Miss Maynell. I am so glad you could meet me; may I take you to dinner?\"\nThe woman's face broadened into a tolerant smile. \"I don't know what this is about, son,\" she answered, \"but the young lady in the green suit who just went by, she begged me to wear this rose on my coat. And she said if you were to ask me out to dinner, I should go and tell you that she is waiting for you in the big restaurant across the street. She said it was some kind of test!\"\nIt's not difficult to understand and admire Miss Maynell's wisdom. The true nature of a heart is seen in its response to the unattractive. \"Tell me whom you love,\" Houssaye wrote, \"And I will tell you who you are. \"",

A lighted cigarette thrown out of a car or train window or a broken bottle lying on dry grass can start a fire. Sometimes, though, a fire can start on its own. Wet hay   can begin burning by itself. This is how it happens: the hay starts to rot   and begins to give off heat which is trapped inside it. Finally, it bursts into flames. That's why farmers cut and store   their hay when it's dry.\nFires have destroyed whole cities. In the 17th century, a small fire which began in a baker's shop burnt down nearly every building in London. Moscow was set on fire during the war against Napoleon. This fire continued burning for seven days. And, of course, in 64 A.D. a fire burnt Rome. Even today, in spite of modern fire-fighting methods, fire causes millions of pounds' worthy of damage each year both in our cities and in the countryside. It has been wisely said that fire is a good servant but a bad master .",

        "passage": "Have you heard of the scandal that happened in one of Great Britain's biggest supermarket chains called Tesco? The British love Tesco as it sells very cheap products and it can be found on almost every corner of a British city or town.\nOn January 15th 2013 food inspectors discovered 30 % horsemeat in a certain brand of frozen beefburgers that were mostly sold by Tesco in the UK and Ireland.\nIn times of social media like Facebook and Twitter the news has spread fast and customers have been very concerned about what the food they buy actually contains. Tesco said it had taken away the burgers from the shop shelves immediately, and apologized to their customers. They also promised that they would find out what exactly happened and that they would work harder than ever so this would never happen again. Customers are also able to return the beefburgers and get a refund, that is, their money back.\nHowever, it will be hard for Tesco to get the people's trust back. Just imagine buying lovely beefburgers that you fry at home and suddenly you find out that you have actually eaten horsemeat! In this case not only horse lovers will be upset!\nBy the way, why are British people so shocked about eating horsemeat? In history, horses have played great roles as working animals and as an important means of transport. When Britons of today think of horses, they think of majestic animals or cute pets rather than meat.\nBut this is not the only reason for the protest: Customers also want to be sure that the products they buy contain what it says on the label. Hopefully, supermarkets can avoid mistakes like that in the future. Maybe there should be stricter regulations and more controls of our food? Otherwise we will soon find ourselves eating panda meat instead of pork and parrot instead of chicken. So the next time you are in a supermarket maybe check the ingredients of your food before you buy it or you could get a nasty surprise ...",

        "passage": "People with disabilities make up a large part of the population. It is estimated  that over 35 million Americans have physical, mental, or other disabilities. About half of these disabilities are \"developmental\", i.e., they occur before the individual's twenty-second birthday, often from genetic conditions, and are severe enough to affect three or more areas of development, such as mobility, communication, employment, etc. Most other disabilities are considered \"adventitious\", i.e., accidental or caused by outside forces.\nPrior to the 20th century, only a small percentage of people with disabilities survived for long. Medical treatment for these disabilities was unavailable. Advancements in medicine and social services have created a climate in which people with disabilities can expect to have such basic needs as food, shelter, and medical treatment. Unfortunately, these basics are often not available. Civil liberties such as the right to vote, marry, get an education, and gain employment have historically been denied on the basis of disability.\nIn recent decades, the disability rights movement has been organized to fight against these infringements(;)of civil rights. Congress responded by passing major legislation recognizing people with disabilities as a protected class under civil rights statutes.\nStill today, people with disabilities must fight to live their lives independently. It is estimated that more than half of qualified Americans with disabilities are unemployed, and a majority of those who do work are underemployed. About two-thirds live at or below the official poverty level.\nSignificant barriers, especially in transportation and public awareness, prevent disabled people from taking part in society. For example, while no longer prohibited by law from marrying, a person with no access to transportation is effectively excluded from community and social activities which might lead to the development of long-term relationships.\nOnly when public attitudes advance as far as laws have will disabled people be fully able to take their rightful place in society.",

She was forced to continue her high school education in her hometown in Sichuan Province.\nShi thinks the current law is unfair for migrant workers' children, as it prevents them from studying at public schools, unless their parents pay huge sums. So, Shi decided to do a survey of migrant workers so that she could find some solutions to help solve the problem.\nIn the last six months Shi spoke to 186 migrant workers in Beijing. Her interviewees include babysitters, guards, keepers, supermarket clerks, house cleaners and construction site workers. Shi found out that 55 of them were parents. Among this group, only eight have children who attend schools in Beijing. The other 47 had to leave children with relatives in the countryside. However, 40 of the 47 would like to enroll  their children in city schools.\nFrom her interviews, Shi found that the workers' lowest income was 400 yuan each month. Over one-third earn a monthly wage of or below 1000 yuan. \"Even schools for migrant workers' children charge more than public schools. Morever, parents constantly worry about these schools closing or relocating,\" she explained.\nShi has recently completed a report about her survey, in which she makes a series of recommendations. \"The government can set up public schools for migrants' children equal to schools for city children.

Should laws be involved in this issue? Is it unfair to ban sales of fur, but not sales of leather and hides  ?\nAnimals Do Not Have Rights\nBy Tibor R. Machan\nMy view is that animals do not have basic rights. It is a matter of ethics   and not of the laws of human societies. If animals had such rights as human beings do, they would have to be held responsible for killing fellow animals in the wild. That way of thinking about animals makes a category mistake. Using animals, including their fur or organs, to improve people's lives is acceptable.\nA Small Step Against Cruelty\nBy Kate Carter\nBoth fur and leather are the skins of dead animals. Why should we think that the lovable furry ones deserve more of a life than the less pleasing ones? Some say leather is  less cruel because it's a byproduct   of the meat industry. But this isn't really true. Some cheap leather may be a byproduct of the meat industry, but often it's the other way round. In South Africa, where there is a developing market for ostrich farms, the skins account for roughly 80 percent of the slaughtered  birds' value, a mere 20 percent of which comes from the meat.\n\"Who\" Are You Wearing?\nBy Marc Bekoff\nWest Hollywood's ban is a move in the right direction. However, we must work to ban the sales of leather and hides, too. Furs come from animals who are attacked to become clothing, while some leather and hides come from slaughterhouse  animals. We must remember that when people choose to wear fur, leather and hides, they are wearing formering conscious beings. So it's a matter of who they are wearing, not what they are wearing because these animals must be referred to as who and not what or that.",

Others have told pupils to leave them at home.\nHowever, education researchers at The University of Nottingham believe it is time that phone bans were reassessed, because mobile phones can be a powerful learning aid, they say. Dr Elizabeth Hartnell-Young and her colleagues have reached this conclusion after studying the consequences of allowing pupils in five secondary schools to use either their own mobile phones or the new generation of 'smartphones' in lessons.\nDuring the nine-month experiment, 14- to-16-year-old pupils used the phones for a wide range of educational purposes, including creating short movies, setting homework reminders, recording a teacher reading a poem, and timing experiments with the phones' stopwatches. The smartphones, which could be connected to the Internet, also allowed pupils to access revision websites, log into the school email system, or transfer   electronic files between school and home.\nThe research involved 331 pupils in schools in Cambridgeshire, West Berkshire and Nottingham. \"At the start of the study, even pupils were often surprised at the thought that mobile phones could be used for learning,\" Dr Hartnell-Young said. \"After their hands-on experience, almost all pupils said they had enjoyed the project and felt more inspired.\"\nSome teachers found that pupils who lacked confidence gained most from the project. However, they recognized that greater use of mobile phones in schools could cause problems.",

They will teach you some of the most important lessons about who you are. This may help you understand different kinds of relationships, what makes each relationship special, and how to communicate in a positive way. \n    What makes a relationship healthy?\n    Communication and Sharing: The most important part of any healthy relationship between two people is being able to talk and listen to each other. You and the other person can find out what your common interests are. You can share your feelings with the other person and trust that he or she will be there to listen to you and support you. In healthy relationships, people don't lie. Communication is based on honesty and trust. By listening carefully and sharing your thoughts and feelings with other people, you show them that they play an important part in your life.\n    Respect and Trust: In healthy relationships, you learn to respect and trust important people in your life. Disagreements may still happen, but you learn to stay calm and talk about how you feel. Talking calmly helps you to understand the real reason for not getting along. It makes it much easier to figure out how to fix it. In healthy relationships, working through disagreements often makes the relationship stronger. In healthy relationships, people respect each other for who they are. This includes respecting and listening to yourself and your feelings so you can set boundaries and feel comfortable. You will find that you learn to understand experiences and feelings of others as well as having them understand your experiences and feelings.\n    How do I know that I have a healthy relationship with someone?\n    You know that you are in a healthy relationship with someone because you feel good about yourself when you are around that person. Unhealthy relationships can make you feel sad, angry, scared, or worried.\n    Healthy peer relationships involve an equal amount of giving and taking in the relationship. In unhealthy relationships, there is an unfair balance. You may often feel that you are giving the other person more attention than that he or she gives to you.\n    You should feel safe around the other person and feel that you can trust him or her with your secrets.  In a healthy relationship, you like to spend time with the other person, instead of feeling that you have to spend time with him or her.",

Still, it can never be bad to get exercise, can it?\nTaking all amateur and professional sports in Britain into consideration, there can be no doubt that football is at the top of the list. It is called soccer in the United States. The game originated in Britain and was played in the Middle Ages or even earlier, though as an organized game, or \"association football\", it dates only from the beginning of the 19th century.\nThe next is rugby, which is called \"football\" in the United States. It is a kind of football played by two teams of fifteen players rather than eleven. The rugby, in which an oval-shaped ball is used can be handled as well as kicked. It is a pretty rough game.\nIn summer, cricket is the most popular sport. In fact, it has sometimes been called the English national game. Most foreigners find the game rather slow or even boring, but it enjoys great popularity among the British.\nTennis rates high on the list, too. It was introduced into England from France in the 15th century, but it was from England that it spread to practically every country in the world.\nTable-tennis or \"ping-pong\" surely is not played on a great scale as it is in China or in Japan.

Thrill-seekers like me are in luck because theme parks are pushing the boundaries of technology to create the fastest, tallest, scariest roller coasters the world has ever known.\nAlton Towers in Britain opened the world's first 14-1oop roller coaster a few months ago, called The Smiler. Over in Abu Dhabi, Ferrari World claims to have the world's fastest one. Ferrari World's Formula Rossa ride sends out passengers from 0-240km/h in just 4. 9 seconds. During this rapid acceleration they experience G-forces only fighter pilots usually  feel: Up to 4. 8G. The designer of several rides at Alton Towers, said: \"While we can stand 6-8Gs for very short periods of  time, ff we experience 5G for more than five seconds we're likely to \"black out.\"\nOn modern roller coasters passengers experience about 3G in tight turns and loops. But while we may have reached the limit in terms of G-forces, there is no technological limit to how fast or how high roller coasters can go---it's all down to money. Alton Towers' The Smiler cost ~18m to build.\nSome companies are finding other ways to keep us amused. There's a move towards indoor rides where the experience is improved by audio-visual technologies. For example, a company called Dynamic Structures is currently developing a \"coal-mine-themed\" ride for a client in Dubai that will combine speed and G-forces with 3D projection effects and robotics, which will trick your brain into thinking you're really falling.\nI can't wait to enjoy this one.

A leopard is far heavier and more powerful, but also much slower. The cheetah's spots cover most of its body except for its stomach and throat. The cheetah's tail has spots and these become rings at the end of the tail.\nAn adult cheetah weighs between 35-65 kilograms and is about 80 centimeters high at the shoulder. The cheetah's head is quite small and the eyes are quite high up. A black line runs from each eye down to its mouth and makes it look a little sad. It has high shoulders that help it to walk so gracefully.\nCheetahs are very fast but they are not very strong. They are not good fighters and will run away rather than fight another animal to protect their food. If they make a kill, it is sometimes taken away from them by stronger animals such as lions and leopard. These animals will kill their young if they get the chance. The cheetah is not a threat to humans at all. It will not attack humans and prefers to stay away from occupied areas.",

In fact, this topic was always mentioned by Zeng Guofan (1811-1872). a famous official during the late Daoguang Period of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912).\nAlthough Zeng spent most of his time away from his family, his letters back home to his children and younger brothers have become famous. In these letters, there are many helpful suggestions on proper behavior . Many of his ways on child education are popular among today's Chinese parents, including reading classical books and so on. His child-raising methods are useful for today's busy fathers. Like Zeng, they also spend most of their time away from home.\nAccording to Zeng,  the purpose of education was to learn wisdom from books, rather than getting an official position. Children should know that the most important purpose of studies is to get more knowledge about nature and life.\n\"But now ,parents just want their children to be rich and powerful. \" Mr. Tang, a writer in China, said.\nSome teachers say that parents need to build a good relationship with their children. Parents shouldn't force  their children to realize their wishes.\nIn Zeng's letters, he asked his young children to do housework as part of their daily life, even though his children had many helpers. He believed that doing housework would make his children more confident and independent .",

It may be a game of some kind, football, hockey, golf, or tennis, it may be mountaineering.\nThose who have a passion for climbing high and difficult mountains are often looked upon with astonishment. Why are men and women willing to suffer cold and hardship, and to take risks on high mountaineering? This astonishment is caused probably by the difference between mountaineering and other forms of activity to which men give their leisure.\nMountaineering is a sport and not a game. There are no manmade rules, as there are for such game as golf and football. There are, of course, rules of a different kind, which would be dangerous to ignore, but it is this freedom from manmade rules that makes mountaineering attractive to many people. Those who climb mountains are free to use their own methods.\nIf we compare mountaineering with other more familiar sports, we might think that one big difference is that mountaineering is not a \"game\". We would be mistaken in this assumption. There are, it is true, no \"matches\" between \"teams\" of climbers, but when climbers are on a rock face linked by a rope on which their lives may depend, there is obviously teamwork.\nThe mountain climber knows that he may have to fight forces that are stronger and more powerful than man. He has to fight the forces of nature. His sport requires high mental and physical capacities.\nA mountain climber continues to improve in skill year after year. A skier is probably past his prime by the age of thirty, and most international tennis champions are in their early twenties. But it is not unusual for a man of fifty or sixty to climb the highest mountains in the Alps. They may take more time than younger men, but they probably climb with more skill and less wasted effort, and they certainly experience enjoyment.",

I have learned over the past years that sometimes when I lose, I get a lot more out of it than winning. Also, I find a lot of times in sports, people are getting too caught up in the game instead of just having fun. The real purpose of sports is to have fun and learn life lessons along the way.\nI greatly encourage you to be a part of the school sports. Even if you are not the best, you can still have fun. Sports give people a great and healthy way of spending an afternoon, instead of lying around playing video games or even getting into bad things. Sports also give us a sense of achievement. There isn't a better feeling than to have done something fun and productive for my day.\nI think that we all need sports to give us courage. If we try hard in sports, we usually do well. If we did the same in study, we would all be champions. Another reason why I encourage you to play sports is that it's just fun. Without sports, our lives would just be boring. So as you may be able to tell, sports are amazing!\nOur coaches not only teach us to play sports, but show class and good sportsmanship while playing them. It's never fun when you lose to have the competitor rub it in your face. That's why our coaches teach us to show class when we lose; also, when coaches _ , don't get down.

So in the middle of the night, his mother called a lawyer named Paul Jobs and said, \"We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?\" But his mother told his future parents to promise that they would send Jobs to college. After Steve Jobs graduated from high school, he went to college but decided to drop out because it was so expensive that he had to sleep on the floor in his friends' rooms.\nAt 20, he and a friend(Steve Wozniak) started a company in a garage on April 1, 1976. Jobs named their company ----Apple in memory of a happy summer he had spent as an orchard   in Oregon.\nAfter 10 years of hard time and failures, starting from two kids working in a garage, Apple computer eventually grew into a big company with over 4000 employees.\nAt 30, Jobs , however, was fired from the company he co-founded. But after he had to leave the company, Apple was under heavy pressure from rival   Microsoft and in 1996 posted billions of dollars in losses. Apple needed Steve Jobs and he was appointed as Apple' CEO in1997. Under his leadership, Apple returned to profitability and introduced new products such as the iPod, the iPhone and the iPod.\nSteve Jobs once said, \"Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick, Don't lose faith. I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking.",

Ted Schredd and Deanna Kopel cycled around North America to show others a way to help the environment. \"Nobody wants to breathe dirty air--but for the air to change. People have to stop driving cars,\" says Ted, \"If more people start riding bikes, the air will be cleaner.\"\nTed started his trip alone. He had $160 in his pocket and plans to cycle around North America. He left his hometown of Vancouver, and when he arrived in San Diego he got the chance to make some extra money for the rest of his 13, 000 km trip. A cyclist he met asked him to speak at an environment meeting in Texas. Within a few hours, Ted was on a plane to the meeting and a big surprise.\nWhen he met Deanna at the meeting, they talked for six hours straight. It was love at first sight. The next day, he called her to ask if she wanted to finish the trip with him. She said yes, sold everything in her flat, gave her notice at work, and was on the road with Ted three weeks later.\nDeanna found Ted's timetable difficult because he got up early in the morning. Deanna was a nurse and usually worked at night. \"All of a sudden, I was up at six when I wanted to sleep until noon,\" said Deanna.\nAs the couple cycled to Florida and up to Montreal and then back to Vancouver, every day was an adventure. They got free meals in restaurants, and slept in people's yards. When they ran out of money, people gave them extra cash. Sometimes people gave away $50 or $100.\nAnd like all good stories this one has a happy ending. On the way back to Vancouver, they stopped in Edmonton to visit Ted's relatives. During the visit, they got married. People tied ten cans and a \"Just Married\" sign to the back of their bikes.\nThey now want to write a book about their trip. \"We want people to know that you can protect our earth and still have fun,\" Schredd said.",

While any of these statements might be true, they are practically impossible to prove scientifically. Still, I was struck by a report which concluded that today's children are significantly more anxious than children in the 1950s. In fact, the analysis showed, normal children aged 9 to 17 exhibit a higher level of anxiety today than children who were treated for mental illness 50 years ago.\nWhy are America's kids so stressed? The report cites two main causes: increasing physical isolation  brought on by high divorce rates and less involvement in community, among other things and a growing perception that the world is a more dangerous place.\nConsidering that we can't turn the clock back, adults can still do plenty to help the next generation.\nAt the top of the list is nurturing  a better appreciation of the limits of individualism. No child is an island. Strengthening social ties helps build communities and protect individuals against stress.\nTo help kids build stronger connections with others, you can pull the plug on TVs and computers. Your family will thank you later. They will have more time for facetoface relationships, and they will get more sleep.\nLimit the amount of virtual  violence your children are exposed to. It's not just video games and movies; children see a lot of murder and crime on the local news.\nKeep your expectations for your children reasonable. Many highly successful people never attended Harvard or Yale.\nMake exercise part of your daily routine. It will help you cope with your own anxieties and provide a good model for your kids.

Instead, they are good medicines.\nFood that people use for medicines is called medical  food. The Chinese have eaten medicinal food and spices  for centuries. Ginger, for example, is a common spice in Chinese cooking. Ginger gives food a nice flavor. The Chinese began to use ginger many years ago. They used ginger not because it tasted good. They used ginger because it was medicinal. Ginger, they thought, was good for the digestion. It also helped people who had colds. Pepper and garlic, too, were probably medicines a long time ago.\nSome people don't believe that food and spices are good medicines. They want to buy their medicine in drugstores, not in supermarkets. Other people want to try medicinal food. They say, \"Maybe medicinal food can't help me. But it can't hurt me, either.\"\nPeople can try medicinal food at a Chinese restaurant in San Francisco, California. The restaurant serves medicinal food.

They will teach you some of the most important lessons about who you are. This may help you understand different kinds of relationships, what makes each relationship special, and how to communicate in a positive way. \n    What makes a relationship healthy?\n    Communication and Sharing: The most important part of any healthy relationship between two people is being able to talk and listen to each other. You and the other person can find out what your common interests are. You can share your feelings with the other person and trust that he or she will be there to listen to you and support you. In healthy relationships, people don't lie. Communication is based on honesty and trust. By listening carefully and sharing your thoughts and feelings with other people, you show them that they play an important part in your life.\n    Respect and Trust: In healthy relationships, you learn to respect and trust important people in your life. Disagreements may still happen, but you learn to stay calm and talk about how you feel. Talking calmly helps you to understand the real reason for not getting along. It makes it much easier to figure out how to fix it. In healthy relationships, working through disagreements often makes the relationship stronger. In healthy relationships, people respect each other for who they are. This includes respecting and listening to yourself and your feelings so you can set boundaries and feel comfortable. You will find that you learn to understand experiences and feelings of others as well as having them understand your experiences and feelings.\n    How do I know that I have a healthy relationship with someone?\n    You know that you are in a healthy relationship with someone because you feel good about yourself when you are around that person. Unhealthy relationships can make you feel sad, angry, scared, or worried.\n    Healthy peer relationships involve an equal amount of giving and taking in the relationship. In unhealthy relationships, there is an unfair balance. You may often feel that you are giving the other person more attention than that he or she gives to you.\n    You should feel safe around the other person and feel that you can trust him or her with your secrets.  In a healthy relationship, you like to spend time with the other person, instead of feeling that you have to spend time with him or her.",

A researcher was appointed to study the performance of some top referees.\nThe researcher organized an experimental tournament involving four youth teams. Each match lasted an hour, divided into three periods of 20 minutes during which different referees were in charge.\nObservers noted down the referees' errors, of which there were 61 over the tournament. Converted to a standard match of 90 minutes, each referee made almost 23 mistakes, a remarkably high number.\nThe researcher then studied the videotapes to analyse the matches in detail. Surprisingly, he found that errors were more likely when the referees were close to the incident. When the officials got it right, they were, on average, 17 meters away from the action. The average distance in the case of errors was 12 meters. The research shows the optimum   distance is about 20 meters.\nThere also seemed to be an optimum speed. Correct decisions came when the referees were moving at a speed of about 2 meters per second. The average speed for errors was 4 meters per second.\nIf FIFA, football's international ruling body, wants to improve the standard of refereeing at the next World Cup, it should encourage referees to keep their eyes on the action from a distance, rather than rushing to keep up with the ball, the researcher argues.\nHe also says that FIFA's insistence that referees should retire at age 45 may be misguided.

As more are discovered all the time, you can be sure of seeing something new each time you visit.\nWe have a free Fossil Identification Service, so you can bring in any fossils you have and find out what they are. In addition, we have a reasonably-priced Museum Shop, where you can buy a souvenir of your visit. You could also bring a picnic and relax in our special picnic area.\nActivities\nFossil hunts are organized from the museum and run all year round. Groups of up to 25 are guided on a local beach where they can search for fossils. All these hunts are fully licensed and insured, and guides can help to identify any fossils found and point out things of interest.\nDue to the popularity of these hunts, all trips must be booked by a personal visit to Dinosaur Farm Museum.\nDid you know...?\nThe BBC programme \"Live from Dinosaur Island\" was filmed along the coast here, and Dinosaur Farm Museum was the base for the television crew.\nFind out more\nCheck out our website at _ to learn in detail how we dig for dinosaurs.

Worried shoppers rushed to stores and supermarkets in the country for salt, with the belief that it might protect them from potential nuclear radiation spreading from Japan.\n    Many rushed to buy to store as much iodized salt as possible because of the rumor that iodized salt could help prevent radiation poisoning spreading from Japan' s Fukushima Daiichi power plant. Consumers also worried that the nuclear plumes might spread  to China by air and sea, polluting food sources, including salt taken from the sea.\n The wave of panic buying spread quickly across the country, driving up salt prices by five to ten fold in some cities.\n Even regions rich in salt production, like Jiangxi Province,faced sudden shortages.\nThe government took measures to guarantee enough supply and to stabilize the market. It also dismissed the nuclear rumors, saying the nuclear fallout was unlikely to reach the country, and that salt did not help to prevent radiation poisoning.\n    Local authorities have stepped in to stabilize the market, too. As well, state-owned salt companies have been urged to increase their supply.\n Facing expanding market demand, distribution centers have taken extra measures to ensure they are well-prepared.\nWang Yun, the General Manager of Beijing Salt Industry Corporation, said, \"Our storage reserves can guarantee a two-month supply for the Beijing market.\"",

        "passage": "Amazingly, US crime figures have been falling for 20 years now. Of course, the big question is, why? And can any lessons be learnt?\n  One reason could be the fall in the demand for the drug crack. During the 1980s, drug-related crimes soared, mostly caused by desperate crack users. However, according to professor Blumstein, co-author of The Crime Drop in America, news of the dangers of crack use caused its decrease and led to a fall in the number of drug-related crimes.\n  Some say that the adoption of a zero-tolerance policy in many cities has helped lead to a fall in crime. In New York City, for example, mayor Rudy Giuliani imposed strict and automatic punishments for all crimes, including minor offences such as graffiti and littering. Many believe this has had a very strong deterrent  effect.\n  Another reason could be smarter policing strategies. Anti-theft measures and educating the community about car theft has helped see a drop in crimes in many areas. Also, the use of crime mapping schemes that can discover identify crime peaks in different parts of the city has helped police target hotspots.\n  Another reason could be that more criminals are now behind bars. Sociologist John Conklin (from Tufts University) says a significant factor behind the fall in crime in the 1990s is the simple fact that many criminals are in jail. In his book Why Crime Rages Fell, he says sentencing was merciful in the 1960s and 1970s, when crime rose. But then more prisons were built and more offenders were imprisoned.\n  Some have linked the fall in violent crime to a decline in children's exposure to lead in petrol. Jessica Wolpaw Reyes says, \"Even low to moderate levels of exposure can lead to behavioral problems, reduced IQ, hyperactivity  and youth crimes. You can link the decline in lead between 1975 and 1985 to a decline in violent crime 20 years later.\"\n  Others say that the drop in crime has something to do with birth rates. According to statistics, birth rates peaked between 1957 and 1961, and the proportion of men in the US in their late teens and early 20s (the so-called \"criminal age\") was highest in the late 70s and early 80s. However, as time went on, the proportion of people in this age group decreased. \n  Others claim that videogames have helped. A recent study has suggested that these games are keeping young people off the streets and therefore away from crime. Advocates of this argue that any effects the games may have in encouraging violent behavior is  _ by the fact that the games keep potential criminals indoors and in front of the television.\n  Some argue that the widespread use of camera phones makes some criminals think twice before committing a crime and getting filmed doing it. Also, many believe that the mass use of CCTV has also had an effect.\n  Finally, some say that petty theft just isn't worth it any more. The resale value of second-hand goods such as televisions, cameras or clothes is now so low (or even non-existent) that most people see no point in stealing. \n  So, what do you think?",

Unlike everyone else, Nigel wanted to join the contest because he liked making something out of the Lego sets. Nigel spent the next two months rebuilding the robot. It was during the time that Nigel found out about the prizes for the competition as well as another competitor, Alicia, from a neighboring school. His early intentions were forgotten. Getting the thousand-dollar prize was more important than anything else. Nigel decided to befriend Alicia. Unaware of his intentions, she told him all about the robot that she had been building for the competition. He even helped her to put the finishing branches to her robot. He was glad with the way things had progressed. His robot was able to become a ball with its arms, which Alicia had failed to do.\nEverything didn't dawn on her until she saw him among the competition. She stared at him, puzzled at first, then angry and finally a look of helplessness came over her.\nThe flashbulbs of the camera exploded in Nigel's try. The robot bird performed actions so unique that the specialist judgments were the same. Nigel was so personal with himself that he did not even notice the girl standing a few feet away from him.

Under the Dome, a 103-minute documentary self-funded by former CCTV news anchor Chai Jing was released on video-sharing websites in China on Feb 28. It has rapidly pushed the public awareness about air pollution and encouraged people to join in efforts to make a difference.\nChai, 39, said she started the work out of her \"personal clashes\" with smog after she gave birth to a daughter. \"I sealed tight all the windows. I started every day by checking the air pollution index,\" Chai said. Millions of other people are also doing the same. While they stop there, Chai goes deeper. \"I don't want to live in this way. 1 need to find out where the smog comes from and what on earth is going on.\"\nOver a year, she investigated polluted sites to find the sources of smog, visited the US and the UK to learn about their anti-pollution experiences, and interviewed officials, scientists and the general public. Chai's research reveals that the burning of coal and oil contributes to 60 percent of PM2.5 pollutants. She thus questions the country's energy consumption habits in the film.\nShe then goes on to disclose loopholes   in car emissions regulations. The film also explains that businesses are pressured not to abide by  the laws because violating  them carries little or no cost, while making changes bumps up costs. The film also points at China's petroleum and steel industries as the biggest sources of air pollution.\nCheng Chen, a 22-year-old student from Beijing Foreign Studies University, found the documentary \"very inspiring\". \"I used to think it's not my duty to deal with air pollution--I don't own a factory or a car,\" said Cheng. \"But Chai told me we share the same fate since we breathe the same air and there is a lot I can do.\"\nHowever, some people are annoyed by the film's description of their polluted hometowns, especially when it shows a banner from Xingtai in Hebei saying \"Congratulations to our city for no longer being ranked the last place among the country's 74 cities in terms of air quality\".\n _ \"What's important is that Chai's work has raised public attention toward the structure of the energy industry,\" she said.   Meanwhile, experts remind moved viewers of the film's limitations.",

Water the plant daily and feed this plant every two to three weeks with a little fertilizer  for acid-loving plants. Prune in early spring, even as early as February.

I begged my  parents to attend every rock concert and watch every TV show featuring my favorite celebrities; my friends and I discussed for hours all the things we would say and do when we met our favourite movie stars and pop singers. I drove my mother crazy ! But after a few years, my obsession stars faded as I matured and gained the confidence to socialize with \"real\" boys.\nIn the 35 years since I was a teenager, celebrity worship   has increased among teens due to the explosion of television celebrity gossip shows, and instant access to celebrity news on the Internet. It's no wonder that many teens are obsessed with stars when news programs are often filled with entertainment stories and the lives of celebrities.\nCelebrity worship syndrome   is now considered a personality disorder. While it is normal for teenagers to follow the lives of their favorite stars, parents should try to monitor everything their child finds interesting. Parents should take action if they suspect a teen is too obsessed with celebrities and showing little interest in school or withdrawing from the family.  When teens talk a lot about celebrities and view them as just means of entertainment, this is considered normal celebrity worship. However, when a teenager is obsessed with a star and  often expresses a desire to have a close personal relationship with a celebrity or feels they have a special connection to a star, this may be the time for concern. Recent studies have shown that teens who develop an unhealthy obsession with celebrities often suffer from low self confidence and depression. Teens who are overly obsessed with stars often have damaged relationships with their parents.",

The United States Department of Agriculture supported the findings. But it says time is needed to clear the way for marketing meat and milk from clones.\nThe F.D.A. will not require any product to be registered  as coming from clones. A producer would need to label   a product \"clone-free\". The agency   says that could be misunderstood because the food is not different from other food.\nBut activists argue that the F.D.A. based its decision on incomplete research into possible risks. The Center for Food Safety criticized the use of studies supplied by cloning companies. Animal rights activists point out that cloning attempts often fail. They say cloning is cruel and can lead to suffering.\nCongress   has been trying to get the F.D.A. to do more studies. But the agency noted that experts in New Zealand and the European Union had come to the same findings about the safety of food from clones. Japan, South Korea and Taiwan say they want to study it further before taking action.\nProducts from cloning may not be widely used for several years.

Researchers from Australia say that the presence of the particles  in an eucalyptus tree's leaves indicates that deposits  are buried many meters below. They believe that the discovery offers a new way to locate the valuable metal in difficult-to-reach locations.\n              Dr. Mel Lintern from Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) said, \"We've found a lot of the easy deposits in Australia in this way. Now we are trying to find the more difficult ones that are buried tens of meters below. And the trees are providing us with a method to be able to do this.\"\n              Using the Australian synchrotron - a vast machine that uses X-rays to explore matter in remarkable detail - they found gold in the leaves, twigs and bark of some trees. The amount of the precious metal in an eucalyptus tree's leaves were tiny. \"We need 500 eucalyptus trees growing over a gold deposit to have enough gold in the trees themselves to make a gold ring,\" said Dr. Lintern. However, the presence of the particles pointed to richer deposits buried more than 30m below.\n              Dr. Lintern said, \"We believe that the trees are acting like a pump. They are bringing life-giving water from their roots, and in so doing, they are taking smaller dissolved gold particles up into the leaves.\"\n              Currently, the metal is found in outcrops ,where the ore  appears at the surface, or it is detected through exploratory drilling.\n              But the researchers said that analyzing plants could offer a better and simpler method to detect untapped gold deposits. Dr. Lintern said, \"Not only do we believe it is a way of saving the exploration cost, because exploring for these deposits can be quite expensive, it also minimizes the damage to the environment because we are taking a very small sample from the trees themselves, as well as the leaves and twigs on the ground.

        "passage": "Immigration is the act of coming to a foreign country to live. The act of leaving one's country to settle in another is called emigration. Immigrants who flee their country because of persecution, war, or such disasters as famines or epidemics are known as refugees or displaced persons. Most people find it very hard to pull up roots in their native land and move to a strange country. But throughout history, countless millions of people have done so. The heaviest immigration worldwide took place from the early 1800's to the Great Depression, the economic hard times of the 1930's. In that period, about 60 million people moved to a new land. Most came from Europe. More than half immigrated to the United States. Other destinations included Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Today, the availability of fast, safe, and cheap transportation helps make migration easier. Asia is replacing Europe as the major immigrant-sending area. The United States remains the chief receiving nation.\nPeople abandon their homeland and move to another country for various reasons.\nThe main reason for immigration has long been economic opportunity----the desire for better land or a better job. During the 1800's, for example, the rich prairie land of the United States attracted many European farmers. Today, professional people commonly emigrate because of better opportunities elsewhere. Such emigration has sometimes been called brain drain. Many doctors and nurses and numerous engineers and scientists have moved to the United States.\nReligious persecution has led many people to move to a new land for the freedom to practice their faith. Such immigrants include Jews expelled from England in the 1200's.\nWars, revolutions, and political unrest have driven innumerable people to find new homes. In the 1990's alone, millions of refugees fled from warfare in Afghanistan, Iraq, Liberia, Iran, Uganda, Southeastern Asia, and Central America.\nSome immigrants were brought to a new land against their will. From the 1500's to the 1800's Europeans shipped black Africans to the Western Hemisphere as slaves. The United Kingdom transported prisoners to Australia from the late 1700s to the 1860s to relieve over crowding in British jails. Before that time, the United Kingdom sent prisoners to the American colonies.\nImmigrants have made enormous contributions to the culture and economy of such nations as Australia, Canada, New Zealand the United States. But their accomplishments have been made with great difficulty. At times, the United States, like many receiving countries, has restricted immigration to maintain a more homogeneous society in which all the people share the same ethnic, geographic, and cultural background. Although some immigration laws have been relaxed, many new comers of different backgrounds still face challenges in gaining acceptance.",

Maybe we can help him find somewhere to live.\"\n\"No, Mom and Dad, I want him to live with us.\"\n\"Son,\" said the father, \"you don't know what you're asking. Someone like the young man would be a terrible burden for us. We have our own lives to live, and we can't let something like this stay with our lives. I think you should just come home and forget about this guy. He'll find a way to live on his own.\"\nAt that point, the son hung up the phone. A few days later, however, they received a call from the San Francisco police. Their son had died after falling down from a building. The police believed it was suicide .\nThe parents flew to San Francisco. To their surprise, they found their son had only one arm and one leg.\nThe parents in this story are like many of us. We find it easy to love those who are good-looking or fun, but we don't like people who make us feel uncomfortable. We would rather stay away from people who aren't as healthy, beautiful, or smart as we are.",

        "passage": "Scientists are using a kind of eye-tracking equipment to learn how babies look at the world. In the lab, children 5 months and older crawl   and walk up, down and over adjustable wooden slopes  , gaps and steps.\nIt may seem like the set for a new reality television show, but there are no prizes, except perhaps for the researchers. They hope to understand what makes one child respond to another, how babies adjust their look to their hands and feet to handle objects, and how these very young children adapt to changes.\nThe findings provided by these eye-trackers suggest that babies may be more capable of understanding and acting on what they see than had been thought. \"Quick looks at their mothers' faces may be all they need to get the information they want. They seem to be surprisingly efficient,\" said John Franchak who studies psychology at New York University.\nAlthough sight might largely seem effortless to us, in reality we actively choose what we look at, making about two to four eye movements every second for some 150,000 motions   daily, said Karen Adolph, also a developmental psychologist at N.Y.U. \"Sight is not passive,\" she said. \"We actively adjust our eye movements to the motions of our hands and bodies.\"\nEye-tracking studies have existed for more than a century, but the instruments involved were typically desk machines. The wearable eye-trackers that Dr. Adolph, Mr. Franchak and their colleagues use are based on equipment developed over the last decade by Positive Science, a New York company, with money from the United States Naval Research Laboratory. They were designed to help scientists. Eye-trackers are currently being used in studies to learn the differences in how amateur and professional geologists   scan landscapes and how people examine signs when looking for exits during emergencies.\nThe researchers also found that during the studies babies looked at their mothers just 16 percent of the time. \"That is lower than expected.\" Dr. Adolph said. A large body of past research has placed importance on children watching the faces of adults as they name objects to learn languages. These findings suggest children may not have to look very long to get the information they need, either from people or objects. This gives a new understanding of how much information they need, or how quickly children might process the information.",

        "passage": "Most Americans receive at least two or three credit card applications in the mail every month.Why have credit cards become so popular? For a merchant, the answer is obvious.By putting charge slips  in a bank, the merchant can change credit card sales into cash.In return for processing the merchant's credit card transactions , the bank charges a fee that ranges between 1.5 and 5 percent.\n         The easiest way to establish credit is to open checking and savings accounts at your local bank.Then apply for a gasoline or store credit card.These cards are fairly easy to get because retailers  want you to buy their goods and services.The third step, and the most dangerous one, is obtaining a major credit card like Visa, MasterCard, or American Express.\n       It is important to choose a credit card carefully because terms and conditions vary widely.Annual fees range from $15 to $75 a year, but some credit card companies charge no annual fee at all.If you will be one of the growing number of people who don't pay off their credit card debts in full each month, look for the card with the lowest interest rate.Interest rates generally range from 12 to 18 percent, though it is possible to find cards with lower rates.\n       A credit card can be your friend because it can get you through unexpected emergencies.And if there is a problem with the products or service you purchase with your credit card, you have an opportunity to hold back payment by asking the credit card company to \"charge back\" to the retailer until the argument is settled.Monthly credit card statements can also help you keep your records in order.Finally, if you make payments on time, the card helps you to establish a good credit history.\n       A credit card can be your enemy because it is an invitation to purchase items you really do not need.The credit card companies' continuous offers of minimum payments, cash advances, and even months without payments may seem like a way to skate through a money crisis.In reality, your finance charges and fees only increase, and you go deeper into debt.\n       If you do find yourself in trouble, do not ignore the bills.Contact your creditors to explain your problem and express your desire to pay down your card balance.If that fails, a nonprofit organization like Consumer Credit Counseling Service can assist you in getting back on your financial feet.",

        "passage": "John Blanchard stood up from the bench, straightened his Army uniform, and studied the crowd of people making their way through Grand Central Station. He looked for the girl whose heart he knew, but whose face he didn't, the girl with the rose.\nHis interest in her had begun thirteen months before in a Florida library. Taking a book off the shelf he found himself intrigued, not with the words of the book, but with the notes penciled in the margin. The soft handwriting reflected a thoughtful soul and insightful mind. In the front of the book, he discovered the previous owner's name, Miss Hollis Maynell. With time and effort he located her address. She lived in New York City. He wrote her a letter introducing himself and inviting her to correspond. The next day he was shipped overseas for service in World War II.\nDuring the next year and one month the two grew to know each other through the mail. Each letter was a seed falling on a fertile heart. A romance was starting Blanchard requested a photograph, but she refused. She felt that if he really cared, it wouldn't matter what she looked like.\nWhen the day finally came for him to return from Europe, they scheduled their first meeting --7:00 PM at the Grand Central Station in New York. \"You'll recognize me,\" she wrote, \"by the red rose I'll be wearing on my lapel.\" So at 7:00 he was in the station looking for a girl whose heart he loved, but whose face he'd never seen.\nI'll let Mr. Blanchard tell you what happened: A young woman was coming toward me, her figure long and slim. Her blonde hair lay back in curls from her delicate ears; her eyes were blue as flowers. Her lips and chin had a gentle firmness, and in her pale green suit she was like springtime come alive. I stared at her, entirely forgetting to notice that she was not wearing a rose. As I moved, a small, attractive smile curved her lips. \"Going my way , sailor?\" she murmured.\nAlmost uncontrollably I made one step closer to her, and then I saw Hollis Maynell. She was standing almost directly behind the girl. A woman well past 40, she had graying hair tucked under a worn hat. She was more than plump, her thick-ankled feet thrust into low-heeled shoes. The girl in the green suit was walking quickly away. I felt as though I was split in two, so keen was my desire to follow her, and yet so deep was my longing for the woman whose spirit had truly companioned me and upheld my own.\nAnd there she stood. Her pale, plump face was gentle and sensible, her gray eyes had a warm and kindly twinkle. I did not hesitate. My fingers gripped the small worn blue leather copy of the book that was to identify me to her.\nThis would not be love, but it would be something precious, something perhaps even better than love, a friendship for which I had been and must ever be grateful. I squared my shoulders and saluted and held out the book to the woman, even though while I spoke I felt choked by the bitterness of my disappointment.  \"I'm Lieutenant John Blanchard, and you must be Miss Maynell. I am so glad you could meet me; may I take you to dinner?\"\nThe woman's face broadened into a tolerant smile. \"I don't know what this is about, son,\" she answered, \"but the young lady in the green suit who just went by, she begged me to wear this rose on my coat. And she said if you were to ask me out to dinner, I should go and tell you that she is waiting for you in the big restaurant across the street. She said it was some kind of test!\"\nIt's not difficult to understand and admire Miss Maynell's wisdom. The true nature of a heart is seen in its response to the unattractive. \"Tell me whom you love,\" Houssaye wrote, \"And I will tell you who you are. \"",

        "passage": "Individuality is the particular character, or aggregate (total) of qualities that distinguishes one person or thing from others. Many artists late in the last century were in search of a means to express their individuality. Modern dance was one of the ways some of these people sought to free their creative spirit. At the beginning there was no exacting technique, no foundation from which to build. In later years, trial, error and genius founded the techniques and the principles of the movement. Eventually, innovators   even drew from what they considered the dread ballet, but first they had to get rid of all that was academic so that the new could be discovered. The beginnings of modern dance were happening before Isadora Duncan, but she was the first person to bring the new dance to general audiences and see it accepted and acclaimed  .\nHer search for a natural movement form sent her to nature. She believed movement should be as natural as the swaying of the trees and the rolling waves of the sea, and should be in harmony with the movements of the Earth. Her great contributions are in three areas.\nFirst, she began the expansion of the kinds of movement that could be used in dance. Before Duncan danced, ballet was the only type of dance performed in concert. In the ballet the feet and legs were emphasized, with virtuosity   shown by complex, codified positions and movements. Duncan performed dance by using her body in the freest possible way. Her dance stemmed from her soul and spirit. She was one of the pioneers who broke tradition so others might be able to develop the art.\nHer second contribution lies in dance costume. She rejected ballet shoes and stiff costumes. These were replaced with flowing Grecian   tunes, bare feet, and unbound hair. She believed in the natural body being allowed to move freely, and her dress displayed this ideal.\nHer third contribution was in the use of music. In her performances she used the symphonies of great masters including Beethoven and Wagner, which was not the usual custom.\nShe was as exciting and eccentric   in her personal life as in her dance.",

It seems that the stars are moving all the time.\nActually, there is nothing wrong with your eyes. This twinkling effect is called scintillation  . Scintillation happens because of air movements in the earth's atmosphere  . Light is \"bent  \" when it travels through different parts of the earth's atmosphere. As the air in the earth's atmosphere is moving all the time, the light from the stars looks as if it is moving too.\nThe same thing also happens to things on the ground. On a very hot and shiny day, if you look at the road, the image in the distance is not clear and things move slightly. You can also see the same effect if you drop a rock into water. The rock appears a little unclear under the moving water.\nThis twinkling effect causes a lot of problems for astronomers   since they cannot _ the stars clearly. A telescope   was sent into space so that the air movements in the atmosphere could be avoided  . It took a long time to build the space telescope but finally in 1990, a huge space telescope called the Hubble Space Telescope was successfully sent into space. Since then, astronomers have many important observations that have helped people understand space better.\n,.  (10)",

        "passage": "I have only once been in trouble with the law.The whole process of being arrested and taken to court was a rather unpleasant experience at the time, but it makes a good story now. What makes it rather disturbing was the arbitrary circumstances both of my arrest and my subsequent   fate in court.\nIt happened in February about twelve years ago.I had left school a couple of months before that and was not due to go to university until the following October.I was still living at home at the time.\nOne morning I was in Richmond, a suburb of London near where I lived.I was looking for a temporary job so that I could save up some money to go traveling.As it was a fine day and I was in no hurry, I was taking my time, looking in shop windows, strolling in the park, and sometimes just stopping and looking around me.It must have been this obvious aimlessness that led to my downfall.\nIt was about half past eleven when it happened.I was just walking out of the local library, having unsuccessfully sought employment there, when I saw a man walking across the road with the obvious intention of talking to me.I thought he was going to ask me the time.Instead, he said he was a police officer and he was arresting me.At first I thought it was some kind of joke\nBut then another policeman appeared, this time in uniform, and I was left in no doubt.\n'But what for?\" I asked\n'Wandering with intent to commit an arrestable offence,' he said.\n'What offence?' I asked\n'Theft,' he said\n'Theft of what?'I asked\n'Milk bottles,' he said, and with a perfectly straight face too!\n'Oh,' I said.\nIt turned out there had been a lot of petty thefts in the area, particularly that of stealing milk bottles from doorsteps.\nThen I made my big mistake.At the time I was nineteen, had long untidy hair, and regarded myself as pan of the sixties' 'youth counterculture'.As a result, I wanted to appear cool and unconcerned with the incident, so I said, 'How long have you been following me?  in the most casual and conversational tone I could manage.I thus appeared to them to be quite familiar with this sort of situation, and it confirmed them in their belief that I was a thoroughly disreputable   character.\nA few minutes later a police car arrived.\n'Get in the back,' they said.'Put your hands on the back of the front seat and don't move them.'\nThey got in on either side of me.It wasn't funny any more.\nAt the police station they questioned me for several hours.I continued to try to look worldly and familiar with the situation.When they asked me what I had been doing, I told them I'd been looking for a job.'Aha,' I could see them thinking, 'unemployed'.\nEventually, I was officially charged and told to report to Richmond Magistrates' Court the following Monday.Then they let me go.\nI wanted to conduct my own defense in court, but as soon as my father found out what had happened, he hired a very good solicitor  .We went along that Monday armed with all kinds of witnesses, including my English teacher from school as a character witness.But he was never called on to give evidence.My 'trial' didn't get that far.The magistrate   dismissed the case after fifteen minutes.1 was free.The poor police had never stood a chance.The solicitor even succeeded in getting costs awarded against the police.\nAnd so I do not have a criminal record.But what was most shocking at the time was the things my release from the charge so clearly depended on.I had the 'right' accent, respectable middle-class parents in court, reliable witnesses, and I could obviously afford a very good solicitor.Given the obscure nature of the charge.I feel sure that if I had come from a different background, and had really been unemployed, there is every chance that I would have been found guilty.While asking for costs to be awarded, my solicitor's case quite obviously revolved   around the fact that I had a 'brilliant academic record'.\nMeanwhile, just outside the courtroom, one of the policemen who had arrested me was gloomily complaining to my mother that another youngster had been turned against the police. 'You could have been a bit more helpful when we arrested you,' he said to me reproachfully  .\nWhat did he mean? Probably that I should have looked outraged  and said something like, 'Look here, do you know who you're talking to? I am a highly successful student with a brilliant academic record.How dare you arrest me!' Then they, probably, would have apologized perhaps even taken off their caps, and let me on my way.",

Unfortunately for the US soldiers of World War II, the chocolate bars the army gave them tasted like they were intended for use in the bath.\nIn the army's defense, it wasn't trying to win any cooking awards. In fact, it specifically ordered that its chocolate bars not be too delicious, so soldiers wouldn't eat them too quickly. These bars were created for survival, not taste. \"They were awful,\" John Otto, a former army captain in World War II said, \"They were big, thick things, and they weren't any good. I tried them, but I had to be awfully hungry after I tried them once.\"\nAs unappealing as the chocolate bars were to some, others like them. Samuel Hinkle, the chemist who created the chocolate bars, pointed out that the number of bars made were far greater than the army needed. \"It soon became obvious that the generous American soldiers were sharing their valued possessions with their foreign friends, whether soldiers of other countries or local citizens.\"\nThe bars turned many hungry Europeans into friends of the United States. \"People wanted them,\" said Otto. \"You'd give them to kids. In some places they were very hungry. And they surely helped relax people about American soldiers.\"\nOtto said he never saw a European _ the chocolate. \"It was food,\" he said. \"At that time, everyone was very hungry. I saw German kids standing outside the US army kitchen. They weren't begging, just standing there very politely. When we were done, the kids would eat the food out of the garbage. They were so hungry.\"\nOther Europeans did not see chocolate until well after the war ended. \"We didn't see any Americans where I was,\" said Elizabeth Radsma, who was 25 years old when the Germans occupied her country, the Netherlands. \"Even after the war, we saw only the British. Maybe the Americans gave out some chocolates in the big cities, but we were only in a small town. Before the British, we saw only German soldiers. But chocolate? Don't make me laugh! Maybe in my dreams!\"\nA soldier in the field might have responded \"Be careful what you wish for\"--and then gratefully bit on a chocolate bar, the only food available for miles.",

        "passage": "\"Show them the money!\" That's what some people are saying for college athletes. They say students who play sports for their school should receive salaries.\nTop athletes should be paid because many of them practice full time, Mark Jameson argues. Rico Cannon, a former college football player, agrees. \"Nonathletes can get a job for extra spending money, but many student athletes spend so many hours in training that they don't have time to work,\" he explains. \"Shouldn't athletes be able to earn extra money too?\"\nThe students also make money for their schools when people buy tickets to their games. The players should receive some of that cash, supporter Robbie Pokora reasons.\nCollege athletes are about honor and tradition, but they're also a business. Thanks to ticket sales, there's money for schools to build new athletic stadiums and give the coaches high salaries. The cash should be shared with athletes. They're the ones out on the field or court working hard for their school.\nThe money matter has others _ , though. Kaitlyn Rentala argues that colleges should not pay their athletes. Students are in school to get an education. Playing a sport is an extracurricular activity, not a job. If athletes need extra money, they can apply for college scholarships . Michael Massett is a middle school teacher and a football and a basketball coach. He agrees. \"Athletes should be paid with scholarships, like nonathletes are,\" Massett explains.\nIn addition, if colleges pay their athletes, those students might focus more on sports than on their education. \"Most students do not become professional athletes after college. If they focus too much on sports, they may not learn the skills they need to get good jobs,\" Kate Macrae reasons. Plus, she says, many athletes have schoolships that help them pay for school.",

What coding has in common with writing, playing music and creating art is that it lets you bring your ideas to life. Coding is all about creativity and music and creating art Crearbing with code CoderDojo helps young perople around the world to learn computer  programming for free. When I went to my first CoderDojo class in Dublin City University in Ireland, at age nine, I didn't know anything about coding or even what it was. But I remember making my very first web page that first day, and being surprised that I could create such a thing. It was a great feeling that I think every young person should experience!\nBy going to CoderDojo every week, I learned how to make websites, apps and games. One of my apps is called Auto-Journalist. It can help journalists   and interwewees do interviews even if they are both really busy or live in different time zones. It is still in development, and I have showed it at an event called Coolest Projects Awards, where young people get to show the public what they have created with code. It's so mucbt fun to share one's creations, and to see what everyone else has made too.\nLearnuing environment\nFor the past three years I have also been helping to teach other young people at CoderDojo DCU. In recent years I have also noticed many more girls attending CoderDojo DCU to try out coding. This has a lot to do with the CoderDojo girls' classes -- girls and young women take part in it with their friends, and it doesn't feel like coding is a \"boy thing\". It is really wonderful to see this, because we need more girls and women in STEM ( Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths). It's a good way to leam more about technology.\nStart early\nOne of the main things I have leamed in the last few years is that coding is not only for adults, coding is for young people, too. And when you are a child it is a great time to start coding, because your imagination is the limit for what you can create !\nWant to leam more?

I do not mean that I was hurt: no one was hurt.\nI do my work in a hot country far away from England. Every September I go there to do my business, and every July I come back to England to have a rest. So every September I go to Paris and take a train from the great French city to Mendova, and at Mendova I catch my ship.\nThere is one very fast train from Paris to Mendova, and it suits me well. It goes as far as Endoran, but it stops at Mendova for a few minutes to let travelers get out or in. It is called The Flying Bluebird. It reaches Mendova at seven minutes past nine in the morning, and it is never late.\nA ship leaves Mendova at half past eleven, and so you will understand that The Flying Bluebird suits me very well. I always travel by it, and I have nearly two and a half hours at Mendova to go from the station to the ship. That is more than enough time.\nWell, one September night, I took my place in The Flying Bluebird as usual. The train leaves Paris at nine o'clock every night, and I was in my place soon after half past eight. There were three or four people there with me, but very soon a lot of others got into the train. When no more people could sit down, they began to stand up near us and also in the corridor . In a short time the corridor was full too, and it was impossible for any more travelers to get into the train.\nI could see a lot of other people outside the corridor windows, but they could not get in, and the train left Paris without them. The man sitting next to me started to ask all kinds of questions: \"Where do you work? How long does it take you to get there? Are you married? How many children do you have? How much money do they pay you every year? How much do you have in the bank? How much do you spend every month?\"\nHe asked questions for about twenty minutes but I did not give him any clear answers, and at last he stopped and began to read the paper.\nI usually sleep quite well in the train, but this time I slept only a little. There were too many people, and there were too many things: small bags, large bags, coats, hats, boxes, newspapers and food. As usual, we got angry about the window. Most people wanted it shut, and two of us wanted it open. But that always happens. It was shut all night, as usual.\nWhen I awoke in the early morning I felt hot and dirty, and glad that the journey was reaching its end. At seven minutes past nine The Flying Bluebird stopped. We were at Mendova, and I stood up thankfully. I took my two suitcases, held one in each hand, and tried to move towards the door into the corridor. In order to get out of the train, I had to pass down the corridor to the door at the far end. There was no other way out.\nI could not even into the corridor. There was a suitcase on the floor by my feet, and three men were standing in my way. I felt a touch of fear. I had to get out, you see; I had to catch my ship, which left at half past eleven. And the train did not stop again until it reached Endoran, two hundred miles away.\n\"I must get out!\" I cried. Everyone there understood me, but no one could move.\nAt last I was able to put one foot over the suitcase on the floor, and I nearly reached the door into the corridor. But then, very slowly, the train began to move. It was taking me away!\n\"Stop!\" I cried. \"I want to get out!\" But no one outside the train could hear me, and the people inside did not care much. The train moved a little faster. What could I do? I was not even in the corridor.\nFear made me think quickly. In front of my eyes, just, above the door, was a notice that told everyone how to stop the train. I had to pull an iron thing near the notice. I did not waste time. I pulled it.\nWell, _ That was to show everyone that there was something wrong. It was not a small sound. Possibly the men in my ship two miles away could hear it. Then the train stopped.\nNo one likes to stop a train if there is no need. But I had to catch my ship. That was the only thought in my mind: to get out and catch my ship.",

If you think that you or someone else has broken a bone, the most important things to do are to stay calm, make the hurt person comfortable, and call the doctor. Do not move the injured body part since movement could make it worse.\nTo treat the break, the doctor will need to take an X-ray. This gives the doctor the information he or she needs to set   the bone: to put it back to its normal place. If the bone is large or it is broken in more than one place, the doctor may need to use metal pins   to set it. After the bone has been set, the next step is usually putting on a cast, the special, hard thing that will keep the bone in place for a month or two.\nYour bones are excellent at healing themselves.

In fact, something far more threatening was at hand, as the Americans were telling Stalin at Potsdam. \nIn 1939 physicists in the United States had learned of experiments in Germany showing the possibility of atomic power and understood the coming damage of an atomic bomb. On August 2, 1939, Albert Einstein warned President Roosevelt of the danger of Nazi Germany's advances in development of the atomic bomb. Eventually, the U.S. Office of Scientific Research Development was created in June 1941 and given combined responsibility with the War Department in the Manhattan Project to develop a nuclear bomb. After four years of research and development efforts, an atomic device was set off on July 16, 1945, in a desert area at Alamogordo, New Mexico, producing an explosive power equal to that of more than 15,000 tons of TNT. Thus, the atomic bomb was born. Truman, the new U.S. president, believed that this terrible object might be used to defeat Japan in a way less costly of U.S. lives than an ordinary invasion of the Japanese homeland. Japan's unsatisfactory reply to the Allies' Potsdam Declaration decided the matter.\nOn August 6, 1945, an atomic bomb, carried from Tinian Island in the Mariana in a specially equipped B-29 was dropped on Hiroshima, at the southern end of Honshu. The combined heat and explosion destroyed everything in the explosion's immediate neighbourhood , produced fires that burned out almost 4.4 square miles completely, and killed between 70,000 and 80,000 people, in addition to injuring more than 70,000 others. A second bomb dropped on Nagasaki on August 9, killed between 35,000 and 40,000 people, injured a like number and ruined 1.8 square miles.",

Later, all citizens were allowed to vote. Thus the town meeting became truly democratic. Town meetings are still common in New England communities.\nIn recent years the town meeting idea has been widely imitated. There are open sessions of this kind on radio and television.

I hate everything about the city and my life.\"\nThen, Zoe received an invitation from an old school friend, Kathy, to come and stay. Kathy and her husband, Huw, had just bought a farm in north-west Wales. Zoe jumped at the chance to spend a weekend away from London, and now, ten months later she is still on the farm.\n\"The moment I arrived at Kathy's farm, I loved it and I knew I wanted to stay.\" said Zoe. \"Everything about my past life suddenly seemed meaningless.\"\nZoe has been working on the farm since October of last year and says she has no regrets. \"It's a hard life, physically very tiring.\" she says. \"In London 1 was stressed and often mentally exhausted. But this is a good, healthy tiredness. Here, all I need to put me in a good mood is a hot bath and one of Kathy's wonderful dinners.\"\nZoe says she has never felt bored on the farm. Every day brings a new experience. Kathy has been teaching her how to ride a horse and she has learnt to drive a tractor. Since Christmas, she has been helping with the lambing -- watching a lamb being born is unbelievable, she says, \"It's one of the most moving experiences I've ever had. I could never go back to city life now.\"",

        "passage": "I was brought up in the British, _ . Strong feelings aren't something you display in public. So, you can imagine that I was unprepared for the outpouring of public grief  at a Chinese funeral.\nMy editorial team leader died recently after a short illness. He was 31. The news was so unexpected that it left us all shocked and upset. A female colleague burst into tears and cried piteously at her desk. Somehow we got through the day's work. The next day was the funeral.\nOur big boss stepped forward to deliver a eulogy and was soon in tears. She carried on, in Chinese of course, but at the end said in English: \"There will be no more deadlines for you in heaven.\" Next came a long-term colleague who also dissolved in tears but carried on with her speech despite being almost overcome by emotion. Then a close friend of the dead man paid tribute , weeping openly as he spoke. Sorrow is spreading. Me and women were now sobbing uncontrollably. Finally, the man's mother, supported between two women, addressed her son in his coffin. At one point, the mother almost collapsed and had to be held up. We were invited to step forward to each lay a white rose on the casket. Our dead colleague looked as if he was taking a nap. At the end of the service I walked away from the funeral parlor stunned at the outpouring of emotion.\nIn the UK, families grieve privately and then try to hold it together and not break down at a funeral. Here in China it would seem that grieving is a public affair. It strikes me that it is more cathartic to cry your eyes out than try to keep it bottled up for fear of embarrassment, which is what many of us do in the West.\nAfterwards, a Chinese colleague told me that the lamenting at the funeral had been restrained  by Chinese standards. In some rural areas, she said, people used to be paid to mourn noisily. This struck me like something out of novel by Charles Dickens. But we have all seen on TV scenes of grief-stricken people in Gaza and the West Bank, in Afghanistan, Iraq and the relatives of victims of terrorist bombings around the world. Chinese grief is no different. I realized that it's the reserved British way of mourning that is out of step with the rest of the world.\nIt was our newspaper's production day. We were bussed back to the office to resume work. No more deadlines for our former colleague, but we had to pull together to put the newspaper to print. The boss invited the team to go out for dinner after work. We relaxed, smiled, joked. There was no mention of the funeral or our poor colleague. Enough sorrow had been shed already. We needed a break.",

Rob knew them so well that he became careless. \n   One night, while camping alone, Rob reached out to pick up a large piece of wood and felt something bite his arm. Rob didn't think much about it. But a little later, his arm began to ache. When he looked closely at it, he immediately saw two teeth marks in the skin of his arm. He realized that a poisonous snake had bitten him. His pulse became rapid. \n   Rob's mind raced as he thought about what he had to do to survive. Rob knew that he should remain calm, stay still, keep the injured arm below the level of his heart and avoid eating or drinking anything, especially anything with alcohol in it. He also knew that cutting the wound to suck the poison out was a bad idea. \n   He used his two-way radio to call for help. As he waited, he washed the bite with soap and water. To help slow the spread of the venom , he wrapped a bandage two inches above the bite and made it loose enough to slip a finger under it so that it would not cut off the flow of blood. Then, after about half an hour, his friend Mike arrived. Mike took Rob to the local hospital, where Rob was given antivenin--an antidote for snake venom. \n   Rob still enjoys camping, but he is now very careful not to disturb snakes.",

When we finished, we got back into our car and before I started it, we noticed a homeless man standing in front of the building.

It was cold and I was sure he wanted something warm to drink; however, it was not this that I remember, because that is not what \"moved\" me. A dog was also walking up to the front of the building. Being a dog owner, I knew that the dog was a mother, and that she had just had some pups  . She was hungry and weak and I felt bad for her. I knew if she didn't eat soon, she and her pups would not live. People walking by didn't even notice her. She was not as pretty and clean as most dogs, but she still deserved   better. We still did not do anything, but someone else did. The homeless man, who I thought could not afford anything to eat, went into the store and bought dog food with all the money he had.",

        "passage": "Studies show that you may be lied to every day anywhere from 10 to 200 times. We say, \"Nice song.\" \"Honey, you don't look fat in that, no.\" But another study showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes of meeting each other. We lie more to strangers than we lie to coworkers. Men lie eight times more about themselves than they do other people. Women lie more to protect other people. If you're married, you're going to lie to your wife/ husband in one out of every 10 communications. If you're unmarried, that number drops to three. But look, if at some point you got lied to, it's because you agreed to get lied to. Truth about lying: lying's a cooperative act. Not all lies are harmful. Sometimes we're willing to lie for the sake of social dignity  , maybe to keep a private secret.\nLying is complex. It's woven into the fabric of our daily and business lives. We're deeply disturbed by the truth. We explain it, sometimes for very good reasons, other times just because we don't understand the gaps between ideals and realities in our lives. We're against lying, but secretly we're for it in ways that our society has practiced for centuries and centuries. It's as old as breathing. It's part of our culture and history. Think the stories from Dante, Shakespeare, the Bible, News of the World.\nLying has great value to the evolution of human being. Researchers have long known that the more intelligent the species, the more likely it is to lie. We human like to become leaders. It starts really early. How early? Well, babies will pretend to cry, pause, wait to see who's coming and then go right back to crying. One-year-olds learn hiding truth. Two-year-olds bluff  . Five-year-olds lie outright and try to control via flattery  . Nine-year-olds, masters of covering up. By the time you enter college, you're going to lie to your mom in one out of every five interactions. By the time we enter this work world to be breadwinners, we've entered a world that is just full of fake digital friends, business media, identity thieves, world-class cheats, ----in short, a post-truth society.\nWhat do you do? Well there are steps we can take to guide our way through the bushes. Trained lie spotters get to the truth 90% of the time. The rest of us, we're only 54% accurate. Why is it so easy to learn? There are clever liars and stupid liars. There're no real original liars. We all make the same mistakes. We all use the same techniques.",

In the sixth grade, Efron's basketball team made it to the league championships. In double overtime  , with three seconds left, he rebounded the ball and passed it to the wrong team! They scored and his team lost the game.\n  But history, as they say, is a thing of the past. Now at 21, Efron is one of People magazine's 100 Most Beautiful People, graces the cover of Entertainment Weekly, Hollywood's most influential magazine, and is traveling the world promoting the third High School Musical film. Director Adam Shankman described Efron as \"arguably the biggest teen star in America right now.\" Simply google \"Zac Efron\" and you get more than 14 million responses. Yes, it seems Efron has a lot to smile about these days.\n  Efron was born and raised in California. He took school seriously. According to Efron, \"he would flip out if he got a B and not an A in school, and that he was a class clown.\" It was his father who encouraged him to act. He took part in school performances and with a local theater group. He also took singing lessons. He graduated from high school in 2006 and was admitted to the University of Southern California to study film. But he deferred --why study movies when you can star in them.\n  Now he has signed on to star in the romantic comedy Seventeen Again and to play in the remake of the hugely popular movie, Footloose. Efron is also earning more than $3 million for his role in High School Musical 3. Not bad for a 21-year-old. But Efron still remembers those bullies.\n   \"You always have to remember that bullies want to bring you down because you have something that they admire,\" Efron said. \"Also, when you get made fun of, when people point out your weaknesses, it's an opportunity for you to rise above.\"\n   Efron has risen all the way to the top of the movie business. And he can now laugh all the way to the bank.",

To blame the other guy is even more human.\nCommon sense is not all that common.\nWhy tell the truth when you can come up with a good excuse?\nThese three popular misquotes are meant to be jokes, and yet they tell us a lot about human nature .To err, or to make mistakes, is indeed a part of being human, but it seems that most people don't want to accept the responsibility for the problem. Perhaps it is the natural thing to do .The original quote about human nature went like this: \" To err is human, to forgive, divine .\"This saying mirrors an ideal people should be forgiving of others' mistakes. Instead, we tend to do the opposite -find someone else to pass the blame on to. However, taking responsibility for something that went wrong is a making of great maturity.\nCommon sense is what we call clear thought. Having common sense means having a good general plan that will make things work well, and it also means staying with the plan. Common sense tells you that you take an umbrella out into a rainstorm, but you leave the umbrella home when you hear a weather forecast for sunshine.Common sense does not seem to be common for large organizations, because there are so many things going on that one person cannot be in charge of everything. People say that in a large company, \"the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing.\"\nAnd what is wrong with a society that thinks that making up a good excuse is like creating a work of art? One of the common problems with making excuses is that people, especially young people, get the idea that it's okay not to be totally honest all the time.

But be careful, carbonated soft drinks have lots of sugar and caffeine . Caffeine is not very good for you in the summer because it takes water out of your body. And the sugar can make you overweight if you drink too much.\nFruit juice\nThere are different kinds of juice. One kind is made only from fresh fruit. This kind of fruit juice may not taste sweet enough for some people, but it is nutritious . Another kind of fruit juice tastes good but has lots of sugar in it. Many young people buy this kind because the advertisements are good. It is bad for your teeth and bones to drink lots of this.\nEnergy drinks\nThese kinds of drinks have caffeine and things that make people get excited in them. They are sometimes called \"party drinks\". Doctors say that if you drink too much of this kind, you may have a heart attack.\nBottled water\nWe have lots of different kinds of bottled water, such as mineral water, purified water and distilled water . They are clean and easy to drink. But it is best not to drink very cold water. It may make your stomach feel bad.\nSports drinks\nMost of these have funny names like \"Scream \" and \"G-Vital \".

By then,scientists say,global warming will have melted 42 percent of the Arctic sea ice. By 2100,only a very few of these important creatures will be left.\nThe report has been produced by the US Geological Survey. The scientists have publicized their findings in the hope of influencing US Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne,who has been asked to put polar bears on the US endangered species list.\nPolar bears depend on floating sea ice as a platform for hunting seals,which are their main food. Without enough ice,polar bears would be forced to go onto the land,where they are poorly skilled hunters,and would be unlikely to adapt to the life on the land in time. Experts say few little bears would survive and the stress could make many females unable to get pregnant.\nThe team of American and Canadian scientists spent six months studying bears,on the ground,from spotter planes and in the lab,using computer models.\nSome team members fear the result is even worse for the bears than what their report says. They say the Arctic is warming faster than anywhere in the world and much faster than their computer had been forecasting. Satellite observations have showed that the ice has decreased to an all-time low.\nHowever,not everyone in the scientific community believes that global warming is happening on such an alarming scale. Another investigation has found that polar bears are still being hunted by wealthy \"sportsmen\" who want their skins and heads. At least ten international companies offer bear-hunting trips.",

Rather than recycle and reduce our energy, we had to think of 365 diffenent things to do and this was no easy task.\nWith the idea of going green every single day a year,Our Greean Year started. My wife and I decided to educate people about how they could go green in their lives and hoped we could show people all green things that could be done to help the environment. We wanted to push the message that every little bit helps.\nOver the course of Our Green Year, we completely changed our lifestyles. We now shop at organic  stores. We consume less meat,choosing green food. We have greatly reduced our buying we don't need. We have given away half of what we owned through websites.Our home is kept clean by vinegar and lemon juice, with no chemical cleaners. We make our own butter, enjoying the smell of home-made fresh bread. In our home office anyone caught doing something ungreen might be punished.\nOur minds have been changed by Our Green Year.

In the sixth grade, Efron's basketball team made it to the league championships. In double overtime  , with three seconds left, he rebounded the ball and passed it to the wrong team! They scored and his team lost the game.\n  But history, as they say, is a thing of the past. Now at 21, Efron is one of People magazine's 100 Most Beautiful People, graces the cover of Entertainment Weekly, Hollywood's most influential magazine, and is traveling the world promoting the third High School Musical film. Director Adam Shankman described Efron as \"arguably the biggest teen star in America right now.\" Simply google \"Zac Efron\" and you get more than 14 million responses. Yes, it seems Efron has a lot to smile about these days.\n  Efron was born and raised in California. He took school seriously. According to Efron, \"he would flip out if he got a B and not an A in school, and that he was a class clown.\" It was his father who encouraged him to act. He took part in school performances and with a local theater group. He also took singing lessons. He graduated from high school in 2006 and was admitted to the University of Southern California to study film. But he deferred --why study movies when you can star in them.\n  Now he has signed on to star in the romantic comedy Seventeen Again and to play in the remake of the hugely popular movie, Footloose. Efron is also earning more than $3 million for his role in High School Musical 3. Not bad for a 21-year-old. But Efron still remembers those bullies.\n   \"You always have to remember that bullies want to bring you down because you have something that they admire,\" Efron said. \"Also, when you get made fun of, when people point out your weaknesses, it's an opportunity for you to rise above.\"\n   Efron has risen all the way to the top of the movie business.

In 2012, the reality talent show , the voice of China, on the Zhejiang Television became the most popular program in China.\nThe reaon for its popularity was really because its excellent quality? Or can we assume that without any opponent, we can't tell a contestant is winning because he is really talented or because there's no comparison?\nThe administrative department really contributed a lot in the popularity of the voice of China. In the past, there was no other draft shows  ranked as high as Super GirlandSuper Boy. Even though there were some draft shows which seemed to share the popularity, it never turned out ture. All the other draft shows were shodowed by the ones on Hunan TV. One example was that since draft shows of Hunan TV were broadcast on Friday night, the draft shows of other stations were shifted to Saturday or Sunday. However, Hunan TV didn't get their permission for broadcasting shows in 2012.\nAnd if this were not bad enough, SARFT did a great favor for it. SARFT issued a regulation, saying that all draft shows should be broadcast after 10:30 pm at night. Zhejiang TV declared long before the regulation that since was \"no audition , no PK, no rise in rank, no voting, no champion\", its program was never a draft show. So, in 2012, all the opponents of Zhejiang TV had to broadcast their draft shows after 10:30 pm while the voice of Chinawas permitted to be broadcast in prime time.\nIf you really think about it, there's no esential different between a draft show and the voice of China. It also selected people from all over the country, how did they say this were different from a draft show? No PK,really? PK doesn't mean one versus one! A team versus a team is called PK too. And \"no rise in rank?\" is just a switch of concepts because at the end of every game, some left the stage and some stayed. If there was really \"no champion\", how come there was only one \"good voice of China\" at the final round? All these were rising in rank, in disguise .\nUnder such cimcumstance, the voice of Chinaeven got praise.

As more and more people try to test themselves against Qomolangma, many a time the mount can be very crowded. Climbers have complained about waiting for hours in the bottlenecks  on the way to the peak. If bad weather strikes, climbers can and do die.\nBut the dangerous crowds aren't the only problem on Qomolangma. All those climbers need to bring a lot of _ --much of them ends up being left on the mountain, sometimes even the peak itself. Mount Qomolangma is becoming the world's tallest rubbish dump. Here's mountaineer Mark Jenkins writing in National Geographic about the state of Qomolangma: \"The two standard routes, the Northeast Ridge and the Southeast Ridge, are not only dangerously crowded but also badly polluted.\"\nBut the good news is that some mountaineers are taking it upon themselves to clean up Qomolangma. Mountaineer Paul Thelen and his friend Eberhard Schaaf are part of the annual Eco Everest Expedition, which has been cleaning up rubbish from base camps to the peak since 2008. So far they've collected over 13 tons of garbage.\nSome of that rubbish is even being used for a higher purpose. As part of the Mount Everest 8844 Art Project, a group of 15 artists from Nepal collected 1.5 tons of garbage brought down the mountain by climbers. They've changed the cans and oxygen tanks--in one case, part of the remains of a helicopter--into 74 pieces of art that have already gone on exhibition in Nepal's capital. Part of the profit from sales will go to the Everest Peakeers Association, which has helped collect tons of rubbish off the mountain.",

He was on his way to attend a three-day sales meeting when he had the flat. tyre. Unfortunately, he did not have a spare, so he pushed the car off the road, locked it up, and managed to thumb a ride back to Pine Grove. It was after eleven o'clock when he finally got home, and it was then that his real problems started.\nWhen Andrew left home at about 5:30, he had told his wife not to expect him back until Thursday or Friday. Knowing that his wife was nervous about staying in the house alone at night, Andrew took the precaution of checking all the windows in the house to be sure they were locked, so that he could report to his wife that the house was secure. He convinced his wife that the house was burglar-proof, and that she would be perfectly safe, providing she bolted  the front door as soon as he drove away.\nAndrew's only thought as he made his way in the dark to his front door was how surprised his wife was going to be to see him, since he was not supposed to be back until Thursday or Friday. He had forgotten about the bolt on the front door. When he turned his key in the lock and the door wouldn't _ he remembered the bolt. And he remembered that he had carefully locked all of the windows.\nAlthough Andrew didn't know it at the time, a next-door neighbor had seen him approaching the house and had watched him go up the steps to the front door. In the dark, it was impossible for the neighbor to recognize Andrew, and, besides, the neighbor knew that Andrew had gone out-of-town for a three-day meeting. As a matter of fact, Andrew had asked the neighbor to keep an eye on the house while he was gone.\nFinding that he couldn't get in, Andrew began pounding  on the front door to get his wife to open the door. According to Andrew, however, his wife is a very sound sleeper, and he knew it was going to be hard to wake her up. In the meantime, because of all the noise he had been making, the neighbor was convinced that somebody was trying to break into the house; so she called the police.\nWhen we talked to Andrew at the country jail this morning, he said that he still didn't understand how the police managed to circle the house without his seeing them. He stated that he had decided the only way to get in was to break one of the dining room windows, and that he was about, to hurl his briefcase into the window to break it when two of the officers grabbed him from behind.\nAndrew could not make the officers believe that he lived there; so they took him off to jail. Apparently, he did succeed in convincing them that they ought to wake up the woman in the house to check his story. But there was no answer when they knocked at the door. He tried to explain to them that his wife was a very sound sleeper, but they concluded there was nobody in the house.",

But not long ago, she couldn't remember her love of the game, her parents' faces or even her name.\nAt 16, the Tennessee honor student and star athlete was hit from behind while playing in a soccer game. She fell to the ground, her head striking the hard ground. The blow knocked out nearly all of Kiger's memories.\nWith no physical  injury or unusual change in her brain, doctors thought Kiger's memory would return in a few days. But it did not. And two and a half years later, it still hasn't. Kiger--who has no memory of her family, her childhood or her life before her injury--has had to create new memories, restart relationships and relearn old skills.\n\"The only thing I had ...I could walk, write, but I didn't know what to write,\" Kiger said of the days after the accident. \"Physically, I was OK, I guess, but mentally  I was troubled.\" Doctors say long-term amnesia  brought on by a less severe brain injury like Kiger's is unusual. \"It's very rare for people to have this lasting problem with memory recovering,\" said Dr Roger Hartl at Weill Cornell Medical College.\nKiger's parents tried to help their daughter return to the life she once lived. \"She didn't know what food was,\" Kiger's mom said. \"She said, 'What is that?' I said, 'Lettuce.\" She said, 'Do I like it?' I said, 'That's up to you to decide.'\"\nKiger's natural ability on the soccer field was the one part of her earlier life that died immediately.

No matter how many times the little ones stumble in their first efforts, most keep on trying, determined to master their amazing new skill. It is only several years later, many psychologists and teachers agree, that a good number of kids seem to lose their natural drive to succeed. For the parents of such kids, whose own ambition is often tied to their children's success, it can be a painful experience.\nFiguring out why _ is the first step. Assuming that a kid doesn't suffer from a learning disability, or isn't involved in some family crisis at home, many educators attribute a sudden lack of motivation to a fear of failure or classmate pressure. \"Everything is within the kids' control; their intelligence is changeable,\" says Lisa Blackwell, a research scientist at Columbia University. \"More than any teacher or workshop,\" Blackwell says, \"parents can play a key role in conveying this message to their children by praising their effort, and progress rather than emphasizing their 'smartness' or praising high performance alone. Most importantly, parents should let their kids know that mistakes are a part of learning.\"\nSome experts say our education system, with its strong emphasis on testing and separation of students into different levels of ability, also bears blame for the disappearance of drive in some kids. \"These programs shut down the motivation of all kids who aren't considered gifted and talented. They destroy their confidence,\" says Jeff Howard, a social psychologist. Howard and other educators say it's important to expose kids to a world beyond homework and tests, through volunteer work, sports, hobbies and other extracurriculum activities.\n\"The problem of the issue is that many students experience education as irrelevant to their life goals and ambitions,\" says Michael Nakkual, a Harvard education professor. The key to getting kids to aim higher at school is to free them of the idea that class work is irrelevant, to show them how doing well at school can actually help them fulfill their dreams beyond it. They need to understand that you have to learn to walk before you can run.",

Let's listen to what she said.\n   While eating at the restaurants in Paris, I noticed the French kids were either sitting in their chairs waiting for their food or eating fish and even vegetables, happy and satisfied. There was no shouting or crying, and there were no pieces of food around their tables. However, my 2-year-old daughter, Beth, took a brief interest in the food. She even threw food everywhere. She couldn't keep herself in her chair and ran around the table. Though by that time I'd live in France for a few months, I couldn't explain it.\n   After surveying French parents, I realized that they aren't perfect, but they have some parenting secrets that do work. French parents seem to have different ideas about raising kids. One of the keys to this education is the simple act of learning how to wait. It is why the French babies I have encountered mostly sleep throughout the night from two or three months old. Their parents don't pick them up the moment they start crying, allowing the babies to learn how to fall back asleep. It is also why French kids will sit happily at a restaurant. Rather than snacking all day like American children, they mostly have to wait until mealtime to eat. French kids always have three meals a day and one snack at about 4:00 pm.",

Most have to pay for these activities. Some adults question if high school students should have jobs. \nSome people worry that teens with after-school jobs will struggle to find time for homework. Actually, the responsibility of having a job helps teens prioritize their time. Many jobs take only a couple of  hour shifts on weeknights. According to a survey, 86 percent of high school students have an after-school, weekend or summer job and students who work between 10 and 20 hours per week during the school year have statistically higher grades-point averages than those who do not work at all. Those who work in high school are more likely to work in college, and financing their college education is a top reason for undergraduates to look for employment. Instead of considering jobs a barrier, employment should be looked at as real-world education. \nOther people think that work adds too much stress, which may be somewhat true, but regardless of having a job or not, there is always going to be stress. Better to learn how to deal with busy schedules in a controlled environment like high school than to be out on your own and alone, experiencing stress for the first time. I personally would be more concerned for the teenager who has to become independent without having any familiarity with working.\nThe biggest reason teens should be allowed to work is that it is a healthy way of earning money. My dad told me, \"Having a job is a good way to save up for things you are going to need or want to do. You get a lot more out of things if you are financially responsible for them.\" Kids need the freedom to choose how to spend their money. The sooner they have an income, the sooner they can learn how to use money wisely. If they are not allowed to work in high school, they may run into trouble in the future.",

Again, the best and most effective test preparation for the ELA test is reading and more reading. The research is quite clear -- students who do well in the tests are those who are good readers. Reading not only builds reading ability, it also helps build confidence -- important for successful test taking!

Most of the countries are in Africa or in the Middle East.\nPopulation Action International researcher Robert Engelman says by the year 2025, about three thousand million people lack water. At least 18 more countries are expected to have serious water problems. The demand for water keeps increasing. Yet the amount of water on the earth the same. Mr Engelman says the population in countries that lack water is growing in these countries will continue to increase.\nThe report says lack of water in the future may result several problems. It may increase health problems. Lack of water often means drinking water is not safe. Mr Engelman says there are problems all over the world because of diseases such as cholera that are carried in water.\nLack of water also may result in more international conflict. Countries may have to fight for water in the future. Some countries, such as Syria, Sudan, Cambodia, and so on, now get sixty percent of their fresh water from other countries. And the report says lack of water would affect the ability to improve their economies. This is because industries often need a large amount of water.\nThe Population Action International study gives several ways to solve the water problem. One way is to find ways to use water for more than one purpose. Another way is to teach people to be careful not to waste water. A third is to use less water for agriculture.

You are considered lucky if you live in a country where you can drink water out of your kitchen tap or bathroom tap. People in some countries have to pay for drinking water at home. So clean water is one of our most valuabe natural resources .\nIn fact, peole waste so much clean water today. In factories lots of water is wasted. At home many people are not taking showers but still baths, and many are brushing their teeth with the tap turned on. Children are no longer taught how to save water....\nYou can save clean water in many ways. For example, if you keep gold fish, the tank water excellent for graden plants. And when you wash a milk bottle, pour the water on your house plants. Putting a brick or a water into your toilet tank many help use less water, saving many gallons over a long time.\nUsing rainwater is another simple way to save clean water. You can use rainwater to wash your hands after gardening, _ the toilet, and wash your car, your pet, your driveway when they are dirty.\nFor the same reason, people in Malaysia are encourageed to use rainwater. If one has a house with a small garden, he would buy a huge plastic tank to keep rainwater for their daily life.",

Is platonic  friendship possible between persons of opposite sex? Let us try and understand.\nWhat is friendship? Why do we call a person our friend? When do we call someone a very good friend? If we care for a person, if we are always ready to help that person and if we share most of our thoughts with a person, they are our good friends. We can always count upon our good friends in an emergency. We are always sure that our friend will understand why we acted in a certain way. We need not explain anything to our very good friends. The friendship is so deep and the relationship is so close, that most of the things are automatically understood by our friends.\nWhat about love? In a relationship of deep love, all the sharing that we discussed above are taken for granted. But love transcends(,) all these. During love, we are attached with a particular person, while in friendship, one may have many friends. A loving relationship makes one so much attached to the other, that one gets pained if his/her beloved is hurt! Love also involves a physical element. Friendship does not have that. This is a vital difference. Nature gives us love so that the species can go forward. Nature does not give us friendship.\nYour heart beats will never increase in expectation of meeting your friend. You will not lie awake at night thinking about your friend. You will not feel totally lost, if you don't meet your friend for a few days. You will not have dreams in your eyes thinking about your friend. But in love, you will do all these and much more. Indeed, there is no comparison between love and friendship.",

The mystery of why he failed to find it haunted  him and filled him with sadness.\nWherever he went to Cuba, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, South America, Panama, down the coast of Central America--it was always the same story. Instead of golden palaces, there were grass huts and palm-leaf tents. Instead of silk-robed merchant princes, he found \"Indians\" who did not have so much as a shirt on their backs.\nWhen Columbus explored the West Indies in 1493,he heard tales of a fierce Indian tribe who literally devoured its defeated enemies after a battle. These people were called by many names in the area, including Calina, Canima, Carib, and Caniba. Columbus recorded the name of the American natives as Canibales in Spanish, a word which came to refer, within a few years, to any eater of human flesh. In the similar fashion, the word Caribbean, a title for the sea as well as for the region, came into English.\nAt times Columbus knew that this new land was not China, not Japan, not the Spice Islands. He seemed to accept it as a part of the earth that the geographers of Europe had never heard of before. It was another world--and he called it exactly that--but Columbus also insisted until he died that land he had reached was an unknown part of Asia.",

Jack was too frightened to wonder who it was. He breathed as deep as possible. The screaming continued. He heard some fast footsteps approaching, so he turned around. It was the old lady! She walked toward him, and shouted \"I told you not to come here!\"\nFrightened to death, Jack screamed sharply and ran home like an arrow. He thought he heard not only the old lady, but also some other people shouting at him, and it made him more terrified. As soon as Jack saw his mother, Jack said, \"Mom! Do you know what just happened at the park?\" Jack's mother nodded, and said, \"Yes, I know. There is a movie shooting tonight in the park.\"",

Murmuring sounds could be heard as they talked quietly. Women nervously performed their domestic tasks, preparing a small meal. Several sad, old men sat mute, their morale very low.\nThe camp was pitched at the edge of a deep valley--so deep that one could barely see the calm water at the bottom. The Indians had been taken by surprise and were surrounded and attacked by enemy forces. They fought bravely, but they were degraded by defeat. Their homes were destroyed. Those who had survived had been pursued by the enemy. The chase  had lasted for days. Persuaded by their leaders to press on, they had made a wrong turn. Their  _ journey ended at the edge of a valley--a desperate situation. Before them was a great hole in the earth. Behind them was the enemy. No wonder they were frozen with fear. Where could they go?\nJust when no choice seemed available to them, several young braves ran into camp. With great excitement they reported seeing a stone bridge across the valley, just a short distance from camp. Most of the tribe discounted this wild story. However, a few hurried to the spot to see for themselves. Seeing was believing! Indeed there was a stone bridge, great enough to accommodate many people and their horses. Without hesitation the people gathered up their children and the belongings they had and hurried across the bridge.\nEnemy braves watched from a nearby cliff. It was obvious that the Great Spirit was on the side of the defeated. The enemy did not follow. Safe on the other side of the valley, the wanderers thanked the Great Spirit for providing the vital link. They had escaped their enemies. \nFor hundreds of miles around, Indian people heard about the miraculous stone bridge. From this incident it was clear that the Great Spirit defends weak people. Many came from near and far to see the magnificent stone bridge. You, too, can see this bridge and even ride across it in a car--in southwestern Virginia.",

        "passage": "Some kinds of mental skills naturally decrease as people get older. Yet research seems to show that some training can improve such skills. A recently published study also appears to demonstrate that the good effects of training can last for many years after that training has ended.\nResearchers at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland wanted to learn how long memory and thinking skills would last in older people who trained to keep them. The people were part of the ten-year research project. They were taught methods meant to improve their memory, thinking and ability to perform everyday tasks.\nMore than 2,800 volunteered for the study called ACTIVE - short for Advanced (Cognitive) Training for Independent and Vital Elderly. Most studied when they were more than 70 years old.\nThe volunteers took one of several short training classes meant to help them keep their mental abilities. One class trained participants in skills including how to remember word lists. Another group trained in reasoning. A third group received help with speed-of-processing - speed of receiving and understanding information. A fourth group - the control group did not get any training.\nEarlier results had established that the training helped the participants for up to five years. Now, lead study writer George Rebok says, the research showed most of the training remained effective a full ten years later.\nProfessor Rebok and his team found that the people trained in reasoning and speed-of-processing did better on tests than the control group.\n\"We are wondering whether those effects which endured over time would still be there ten years following the training, and in fact, that's exactly what we found.\"\nThe effect on memory, however, seemed not to last as long. Still, the old people in any of the three classes generally reported less difficulty in performing daily activities than the control group. The total training time for the older people was between 10 and 15 hours.",

He watched her until she went far away, and then he whistled to his dog and went directly to the river nearby.\n\"Thank you, dear! You are a nice little boy\" he repeated the woman's words. Then in a low voice he said to his dog, \"You are a nice little dog!\" Tiger raised its ears as if it understood.\n\"Unum! Even a dog likes it!\" he said. \"Well, Tiger, I won't say unkind words to you any more.\" Tiger waved its tail happily.\nThe boy thought and thought. Finally he looked at himself in the river. He saw nothing but a dirty boy. He washed his face carefully. Again he looked. He saw a clean nice boy. He was amazed. From then on, he had a new life.\nAfter telling this, the businessman stopped for a while, and then he said, \"Ladies and gentlemen, this is the very place where that kind woman planted in me the first seed of kindness.

So are most of the expressions made with the word \"hot\".  But not always, as we shall see. \nTake the phrase \"hot potato\" for example. The potato is a popular vegetable in the United States. Many people like baked potatoes, cooked in an oven or fire. Imagine trying to carry a hot, baked potato in your hand. It would be difficult, even painful, to do so. One such hot potato is taxes. Calling for higher taxes can mean defeat for a politician. And yet, if taxes are not raised, some very popular government programs could be cut, which can also make a politician very unpopular. \nAnother expression is \"not so hot\". If you ask someone how she feels, she may answer: \"Not so hot. \" What she means is that she does not feel well. \"Not so hot\" is also a way of saying that you do not really like something. \n\"A hot shot\" is a person, often a young person, who thinks he can do anything. At least he wants to try. He is very sure he can succeed. But often he fails. The expression came from the army. A hot shot was a soldier who fired without aiming carefully.\nA person who becomes angry easily is called \"a hothead\". An angry person's neck often becomes red. We say he is \"hot under the collar\". You could say that your friend is no hothead. But he got hot under the collar when someone took his radio. \nThe hot line was a direct communication link between the leaders of the Soviet Union  and the United States. The hot line had an important purpose: to prevent accidental war between the two competitors during the period known as the Cold War.

However, the plant is grown not only for its beautiful flowers, but also for its oil that has a host of health benefits. Sunflower oil prevents diseases, lowers cholesterol levels, keeps the heart healthy, and even prevents certain forms of cancer. Sunflower oil is a kind of \"magic oil\" when it comes to skin care, as it makes your skin soft and smooth, and prevents signs of aging. So, let us know more about its effects on your skin.\n1. It Acts as an Effective Emollient .\nSunflower oil is an effective emollient, which means that it helps the skin retain moisture. Thus, people with dry skin can benefit immensely from the regular use of the oil. Also, it is mild, and provides relief from irritation and inflammation of the skin.\n2. It Offers Sun Protection.\nSunflower oil is a rich source of vitamin E. The high vitamin content prevents the sensitive cells of the skin from being damaged by the ultraviolet (UV) rays of the sun. Also, the beta-carotene (b-) present in sunflower oil helps neutralize  free radicals that are responsible for causing damage to the skin, including sunburn and skin cancers.\n3. It Prevents Earlier Aging.\nVitamin E present in sunflower oil not only protects the skin from sun damage, but also from earlier aging. What's more, regular use of sunflower oil can reduce wrinkles and make one look younger. Also, sunflower oil is rich in antioxidants  that keep the skin fresh.\n4. It Prevents Skin Infections .\nSunflower oil is a rich source of essential fatty acids that protect the skin from bacterial infections. Hence, it gives you a healthy skin.\n5. Additional Effects.\nThere are other ways in which sunflower oil can prove to be a boon for your skin. These are given as follows:\nIt helps reduce dark spots; it helps lighten dark circles; it helps soften rough and dry skin; it can be used to remove make-up; it helps relax tired eyes.",

        "passage": "History is full of cases where dreams have been a pathway to creativity and discovery. A striking example is provided by Dr. Otto Loewi, a pharmacologist and winner of a Nobel Prize. Loewi had spent years studying the chemical transmission  of nerve impulses  . A major breakthrough in his research came when he dreamed of an experiment three nights in a row. On the first two nights he woke up and wrote down the experiment quickly and untidily on paper. But the next morning, he couldn't tell what the notes meant. On the third night, he got up after having the dream. This time, instead of making notes he went straight to his laboratory and performed the important experiment. Loewi later said that if the experiment had occurred to him while awake he would not have given it another thought.\nLoewi's experiment gives some insight into using dreams to produce creative solutions. Nervous feelings are reduced during dreaming, which may be especially useful in solving problems that require a fresh point of view.\n Being able to take advantage of dreams for solving is improved if you \"set\" yourself before sleeping. Before you go to bed, try to think intently about a problem you wish to solve. Bury yourself in the problem by stating it clearly and reviewing all relevant information. Then use the suggestions listed in the previous section to catch your dreams. Although this method is not guaranteed to produce an original solution or a new insight, it is certain to be an adventure.

They watch shows like Beverly Hills 90210 andMelrose Placeand feel they need to look as thin as the actresses on these shows. Society is brainwashing young people into believing that being thin is important and necessary.\nDiet commercials are constantly appearing on our television screens telling us that once we lose weight, we will be happy. While you're standing at the grocery store you are surrounded by magazines claiming to have the newest and best diet. Each month another new diet appears claiming to be the diet to end all diets. If diets really worked, then why are there so many of them? The reason a new diet pops up each month, is that last's month's diets did not work. The truth of the matter is that DIETS DON'T WORK.\nThe diet and fashion industries are not totally to blame for society's obsession with thinness. We are the ones keeping them in business. We buy into the idea that we can attain the \"ideal\" body image. We allow ourselves to believe the lies being thrown at us constantly. We are throwing away our hard earned money trying to live up to the standards that society has set for us. It's unfortunate, but in today's society, people have forgotten that it's what's inside a person that counts, not what's on the outside. We need to start loving and accepting each other for who we are, not what we look like.\nOnce again, I would like to stress the fact that diets don't work. Eating three healthy meals a day, a few snacks and doing moderate exercise, will allow your body to go to its natural set point.

Decades ago, Kodak invented the first digital camera in 1975 -- but in a fateful decision, the company chose to focus on its traditional film business. \nLarge companies have a difficult time switching into new markets. For example, although Kodak predicted the rise of digital photography, its culture was too rooted in the successes of the past to fully welcome the future. In the past, their history was so important to them. Now their history has become a liability. \nKodak's downfall over the last several decades was dramatic. The 1980s brought new competition from Japanese film company Fuji Photo, which weaken Kodak by offering lower prices. Kodak's decision not to pursue the role of official film for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics was a major loss.

        "passage": "Have you heard of the scandal that happened in one of Great Britain's biggest supermarket chains called Tesco? The British love Tesco as it sells very cheap products and it can be found on almost every corner of a British city or town.\nOn January 15th 2013 food inspectors discovered 30 % horsemeat in a certain brand of frozen beefburgers that were mostly sold by Tesco in the UK and Ireland.\nIn times of social media like Facebook and Twitter the news has spread fast and customers have been very concerned about what the food they buy actually contains. Tesco said it had taken away the burgers from the shop shelves immediately, and apologized to their customers. They also promised that they would find out what exactly happened and that they would work harder than ever so this would never happen again. Customers are also able to return the beefburgers and get a refund, that is, their money back.\nHowever, it will be hard for Tesco to get the people's trust back. Just imagine buying lovely beefburgers that you fry at home and suddenly you find out that you have actually eaten horsemeat! In this case not only horse lovers will be upset!\nBy the way, why are British people so shocked about eating horsemeat? In history, horses have played great roles as working animals and as an important means of transport. When Britons of today think of horses, they think of majestic animals or cute pets rather than meat.\nBut this is not the only reason for the protest: Customers also want to be sure that the products they buy contain what it says on the label. Hopefully, supermarkets can avoid mistakes like that in the future. Maybe there should be stricter regulations and more controls of our food? Otherwise we will soon find ourselves eating panda meat instead of pork and parrot instead of chicken. So the next time you are in a supermarket maybe check the ingredients of your food before you buy it or you could get a nasty surprise ...",

The study was published in the medical journalLancet.Doctors found that patients who got TXA had a 15percent lower chance of dying from _ than those who didn't get it . They also had a 10 percent lower chance of dying from any other cause, including organ failure and a head injury. The study was paid for by the British government.\nThe drug is commonly used in wealthy countries during elective surgeries  to stop bleeding , but isn't used for accident victims. TXA is off-patent and made by many companies. It costs about $4.5 per gram, and a typical dose is two grams. It is usually given via an injection  and would be relatively easy to introduce, even in poor countries, experts said.\nPrevious tests of the drug regarded its use in elective surgeries, such as heart operations, but this was the first study to test the drug on accident victims. Doctors were worried it might increase side effects such as blood clots  in the heart and lungs, strokes, or heart attacks. There was no evidence of that in theLancet study, though the authors said it was possible they might have missed some of these incidents.\nFor people between 5 and 45, accidents are the second leading cause of death worldwide after AIDS, and about 600,000 injured patients bleed to death every year. Experts estimated that if TXA were readily available, between 70,000 and 100,000 lives a year could be saved. Though the drug wasn't tested on children , experts said it would almost certainly work with them as well.",

Suddenly, she could hear another sound, so she opened her eyes and looked down at the sand. It was moving! All of a sudden she could see a tiny head coming out. Then a turtle  appeared! One by one they struggled out of their underground nests. Mira looked in surprise at the baby turtles.\nMira knew the turtles should head towards the waves and swim away, so she was puzzled when they began to pull themselves towards the dunes . Suddenly, she remembered something her grandmother had told her.\n\"Sea turtles bury their eggs on the beach every year in April and in September. Those baby turtles hatch  and head back down to the sea. But some of them never make it. Sometimes they die going across the dunes, trying to find those bright lights on the houses. Every day there are more houses being built on the dunes. That means more and more lights to confuse the sea turtles.\"\nMira looked out across the dunes at her house. Mira saw her mother and father, sitting on the porch . She could see them because her house had two bright lights that lit up the porch.\nMira began to run to her house and shouted, \"The turtles are hatching! We have to help the turtles!\" With these words, Mira ran into the house and turned off the bright porch lights.\nIn a rush she was off running down the dunes with her whole family following her. They reached the beach just in time to see the tiny turtles slipping silently into the waves. Mira watched as the last turtle entered the water. As the turtle swam away, it looked back at Mira. In the moonlight, Mira thought she saw it smile.",

The population of the UK is about 63,000,000.\nLatest figures from Cancer Research UK show smoking is the biggest avoidable risk factor  , followed by unhealthy diets. The charity advises people to live healthily, limit alcohol intake and do regular exercise.\nAccording to the figures from 2007 to 2011, more than 300,000 cases of cancer recorded were linked to smoking. A further 145,000 were linked to unhealthy diets containing too much processed food. Obesity contributed to 88,000 cases and alcohol to 62,200. Sun damage to the skin and physical inactivity were also contributing factors.\nProfessor Max Parkin, a Cancer Research UK statistician, says, \"There's now little doubt that certain lifestyle choices can have a big influence on cancer risk, with research around the world all pointing to the same key risk factors.\"\n\"Of course everyone wants to enjoy some extra treats during the Christmas holidays so we don't want to ban beef pies and wine but it's a good time to think about taking up some healthy habits.\"\n\"Leading a healthy lifestyle can't guarantee someone won't get cancer but _ by taking positive steps.\"\nPublic Health England says a healthy lifestyle can play an important role in reducing cancer risk. It says campaigns such as Smokefree, Dry January and Change4Life Sugar Swaps all aim to raise public awareness. It's important that we not only continue to make progress in noticing cancer earlier and improving treatments, but helping people understand how they can reduce their risk of developing cancer in the first place remains important in dealing with cancer.",

There was a high school student robbed three times last year, twice in her school building. There was a girl who got a piece of glass placed in her eye during school and was saved from a possible cornea transplant   only because, having disobeyed the cellphone ban, she was able to call her mother and get an operation on time.\nThe ban has been on for years, but it set off a widespread parental outcry only in April, after some headmasters sent home letters reminding parents that cellphones are not allowed to be brought into school.\nMr Bloomberg has defended the ban, saying that cellphones are bad and often used to cheat or call in friends for fights. If something is important, he says, parents can call schools directly.\nOn the other hand, many of the e-mail messages from parents described the ban as \"cruel and heartless\", \"absurdly  wrong-headed\", \"anti-parent\", \"ridiculous\".\n\"We respect the fears that parents have,\" David Cantor, a spokesman for Schools Minister Joel I.

Lifestyle gives a false sense of peace and acceptability that comes from others recognizing what you've bought into (as well as bought). If your car, clothes, and home are expensive, you're sophisticated  and stylish. If you have the right kind of job or go to the right social gatherings, then you receive the insincere approval of others. This means that your self-esteem  is always at the mercy of others, with no appreciation of you as an individual.\nA life, on the other hand, is very different. A life is what you lead when you know what matters most to you. It is very simple and comes from being connected to what you know is important and being willing to put that first, no matter what others may think. When you create a life vs. a lifestyle, your self-esteem comes from what's inside you, not what others think about you.\nLifestyle is expensive financially and personally, because it costs a great deal to keep up appearances and do what you think is socially acceptable. A life is not expensive. Rather than using personal or financial resources, a life generates energy and staying power. It's about liberating yourself from the mindless consumption that society expects. It is about making the choices that are in line with your values, instead of using up your bank account or energy for no heart-driven reason.\nHow can you make the change? Understand the difference between a life and a lifestyle. Analyze your current lifestyle to see what is costing you in money, time, stress, and energy to maintain it.

He became my memory, telling me about my school, friends, previous girlfriends and holidays, showing me family photographs, and telling me how perfect I was.\nWith his encouragement I slowly recovered and tried to become the person everyone around me loved. Then years later, when my memories flooded back, I learned that I was anything but perfect--I was troublesome, selfish, and now very angry with Marcus for having lied to me.\nBut finally I understood. Out of love, Marcus had chosen not to tell me about my dark side. He wanted me to have a fresh start--and in fact I had one. Thanks to him, I was able to get married and have kids.

With over 650 titles sold in 118 countries, it annually sells six million copies, giving guidance to travelers in locations worldwide.\nTony Wheeler and his wife Maureen Wheeler were the founders of Lonely Planet Publications and its first writers. They put together Lonely Planet's first publication- Across Asia on the Cheap.  Originally from Australia,  the couple had decided to travel from Europe back home to Australia overland-going through the countries of Iran,\nAfghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, and South-East Asia, to eventually reach Australia. Tourist facilitres were limited in these countries, so if travelers wanted to go there, they had to eat and sleep locally. Many of these travelers were young and adventurous, but they didn't have much money, so going local was the only way that they could afford to travel across Asia. Frustrated that there was no guidebook to give budget travelers information on accommodations, food, and transport in these regions, the Wheelers decided to write a guidebook themselves. Full of humor and strong opinions, the book became famous among backpackers-budget travelers-as the chief travel guide for Asia. It made enough money for the Wheelers to travel more and finance their second book about traveling in Southeast Asia on a Shoestring.\nThis second book became even more popular and acquired readership outside of Australia in North America, Europe, and New Zealand. Sales developed so well that the Wheelers were able to open up a publishing house in Australia, and eventually opened up offices in the United States and Europe. Because the guidebooks were based off contributing writer's experiences, material was fresh and up to date. As more and more books were written, the series finally came to cover every country in the world.",

The most difficult part of their trip was crossing \"the Great American Desert\" in the western part of the United States by horse and wagon.\nThe western desert can be very dangerous. There is little water and there are few trees. But the desert also has scenery of great beauty. Tall towers of red and yellow stone rise sharply from the flat, sandy valley floor. The scene has been photographed many times and appears in movies and on TV.\nIn Arizona, man-made dams across the Colorado River have made two large lakes in the middle of the dry desert country. At Lake Powell, the red stone arch of Rainbow Bridge rises high above the blue lake.\nThere are few roads. Many areas of Lake Powell's shore can only be reached by boat or on foot. But hikers in this empty desert land sometimes find very old native American pictures, painted on the rocks.\nIn Death Valley, California, the summer temperature rises to 130degF--165degF. There is less than inches of rain each year. Death Valley is the lowest place in America---925 metres below sea level. In the 1800s, many travelers died when they tried to cross this waterless valley in the terrible heat.\nAlthough the desert is dry and seems empty, there is plenty of life if you look closely. Snakes and rats have learned how to live in the desert heat. They live underground and come out at night, when it is cool. Plants such as cacti need very little water. When it does rain in the desert (sometimes only once or twice a year), plants grow quickly, and flowers open in a single day.

Now, an art show called \"Doctor Strong From Then to Now\" is travelling around the United States. The pictures and drawings show the history of Doctor Strong.\nDoctor Strong first became famous almost fifty years ago when his first children's book was published. Since then, he has written forty-five books that have sold more than one hundred million copies around the world.\nDoctor Strong's books are known for their easy use of words and colorful, hand-drawn pictures. These drawings bring life to his imaginary creatures. The Cat in the Hat, Horton the Elephant, The Grinch Who Stole Christmas, and hundreds of others.\nThe San Diego Museum, in California, organized the art show. It included about three hundred Doctor Strong's original  drawings and some of his writings.\nMost of Doctor Strong's books, although written in a funny way, have serious messages. For example, in Mc Elligot's Pool, he describes the danger of pollution. He discusses the arms race in The Butter Battle Book, written in nineteen eighty-four.\nDoctor Strong is almost eighty-four years old now. He says he never planned to write stories just for children. He says he writes stories that interest people of all ages. He says he uses easy words so that everyone, even a child, can understand.",

        "passage": "The U. S. Postal Service (USPS) is losing billions of dollars a year. The government company that delivers \"small mail\" is losing out to email and other types of electronic communication. First-class mail amount fell from a high point of 104 million pieces in 2000 to just 64 million pieces by 2014.\nCongress permits the 600.000-empIoyee USPS to hold a monopoly   over first-class and standard mail. The company pays no federal, state or local taxes; pays no vehicle fees; and is free from many regulations on other businesses. Despite these advantages, the USPS has lost $52 billion since 2007, and will continue losing money without major reforms.\nThe problem is that Congress is preventing the USPS from reducing costs as its sales decline, and is blocking efforts to end Saturday service and close unneeded post office locations. USPS also has a costly union-dominated workforce that slows the introduction of new ideas or methods down. USPS workers earn significantly higher payment than comparable private-sector workers. The answer is to privatize the USPS and open postal markets to competition. With the rise of the Internet, the argument that mail is a natural monopoly that needs government protection is weaker than ever.\nOther countries facing declining letter amounts have made reforms Germany and the Netherlands privatized their national postal companies over a decade ago, and other European countries have followed suit. Britain floated shares of the Royal Mail on its stock exchange in 2013. Some countries, such us Sweden and New Zealand, have not privatized their national postal companies, but they have opened them up to competition.\nThese reforms have driven efficiency improvements in all of these countries. Additional number of workers have been reduced, productivity has risen and consumers have benefited. Also, note that cost-cutting measures--such as closing tone post offices--are good for both the economy and the environment.\nPrivatization and competition also encourage new changes. When the USPS monopoly over \"extremely urgent\" mail was stopped in 1979, we saw an explosion in efficient overnight private delivery by firms such as FedEx.\nThe government needs to wake up to changing technology, study postal reforms abroad and let businessmen reinvent our out-of-date postal system.",

Every school has its own rules.\nThere are some rules in Japanese schools. The students are not allowed to dye their hair and are supposed to keep their hair black.

To blame the other guy is even more human.\nCommon sense is not all that common.\nWhy tell the truth when you can come up with a good excuse?\nThese three popular misquotes are meant to be jokes, and yet they tell us a lot about human nature .To err, or to make mistakes, is indeed a part of being human, but it seems that most people don't want to accept the responsibility for the problem. Perhaps it is the natural thing to do .The original quote about human nature went like this: \" To err is human, to forgive, divine .\"This saying mirrors an ideal people should be forgiving of others' mistakes. Instead, we tend to do the opposite -find someone else to pass the blame on to. However, taking responsibility for something that went wrong is a making of great maturity.\nCommon sense is what we call clear thought. Having common sense means having a good general plan that will make things work well, and it also means staying with the plan. Common sense tells you that you take an umbrella out into a rainstorm, but you leave the umbrella home when you hear a weather forecast for sunshine.Common sense does not seem to be common for large organizations, because there are so many things going on that one person cannot be in charge of everything. People say that in a large company, \"the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing.\"\nAnd what is wrong with a society that thinks that making up a good excuse is like creating a work of art? One of the common problems with making excuses is that people, especially young people, get the idea that it's okay not to be totally honest all the time.

        "passage": "Computer power is moving into the \"cloud\"--networks of data centres that use the Internet to supply all kinds of services, from e-mail and social networks to data storage and analysis.\nThe rise of cloud computing is rapid and causing huge changes in the tech industry. The old guard is suffering: this week's $67 billion merger   between Dell and EMC, makers of computers and storage devices respectively  , was a marriage forced by the rise of the cloud. Disruptive   newcomers are blooming: if Amazon's cloud-computing unit were a stand-alone public company, it would probably be worth almost as much as Dell and EMC combined.\nThe gains for customers have been equally dramatic. Compared with older IT systems, cloud computing is often much cheaper. It adds tremendous flexibility: firms that need more computing capacity no longer have to spend weeks adding new servers and installing software. In the cloud they can get hold of it in minutes. Their applications can be updated continually, rather than just every few months. Individual users can reach their e-mails, files and photos from any device. And cloud services also tend to be more secure, since providers know better than their customers how to protect their computing systems against hackers.\nBut cloud computing makes one problem worse. In the old IT world, once a firm or a consumer had decided on an operating system or database, it was difficult and costly to switch to another. In the cloud this \"lock-in\" is even worse. Cloud providers go to great lengths to make it easy to upload data. They accumulate huge amounts of complex information, which cannot easily be moved to an alternative provider.\nCloud firms also create a world of interconnected services, software and devices, which is convenient but only for as long as you don't venture   outside their universe. Being locked in to a provider is risky. Firms can start to tighten the screws by increasing prices. If a cloud provider goes bust  , its customers may have trouble getting back their data.\nThese risks have already caused a debate about whether the cloud needs stricter regulation. Some European politicians want to force cloud providers to ensure that data can be moved between them. That is too heavy-handed, because strict rules will inhibit   innovation in what is still a young industry. The history of computing suggests that common standards may well appear naturally in response to customers' demands--just as in personal computers, where it is now much easier to use the same files on different systems.\nIn the meantime, a few commonsense measures can reduce the risk of lock-in. Firms that use more than one cloud provider to host their data are less affected. So are those that keep their most important information in their own data centres. Consumers can take precautions, too. Some services are better than others at enabling users to move data between providers (Google does well on this score). Cloud computing promises its users many benefits, but don't mistake it for some sort of digital heaven.",

The athletes then go on to famous sports universities, where they exhaust their playing years before landing back on the streets without job opportunity or college degrees.\nThe prep school scheme was meant to avoid academic qualification rules for college athletes made years ago by the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The N.C.A.A., which was slow to recognize the seriousness of the problem, has finally adopted policies to root it out. But those policies will not do the job unless everyone is involved, including prep schools and college athletics departments that still recruit   students who do not meet academic standard.\nThe prep school scheme sends a dangerous message to poor neighborhoods, where young people too often ignore their studies, believing that they will magically become millionaires once the world sees their athletic talents. Even worse, it encourages students to drop out of traditional schools before graduation--at which point their grade-point averages would be written in stone--to sign up with fake schools that can help them rewrite their academic records.\nThe N.C.A.A. has begun to check nontraditional schools for their academic programs and has actually closed some. The organization has also stepped up to look into athletes' transcripts and will pay special attention to athletes who attended several schools, showed sudden jumps in grade-point average, transferred to another school late in the senior year or took an unbelievable number of courses in one term.\nThese measures are encouraging as far as they go. But the N.C.A.A. will need to go much deeper into the problem if it hopes to break this scheme. For starters, it needs to make clear not just what courses high school athletes need to take to become qualified for college sports, but when they should take them. Until that happens, those who recruit young athletes will always be tempted to make fake academic record at the last possible moment for them.",

It has been designed so that the wings fold up automatically; and it takes just 15 seconds to switch between flying and driving. With its wings fully open and the propeller spinning, it can take off from any airfield.\nFlying cars are quicker than traditional ones for travelling from city to city,and they can run on ordinary fuel. Another big advantage is that they are cool ,like something you would see in an action film. At the moment9however, the flying car's wheels are illegal to leave the ground. That is not because of technical reasons or problems with the design. It is because the various road and aircraft authorities simply cannot agree on whether it is a car or a plane.\n\"The government and the authorities have never thought seriously about a flying car, says Alan Price ,the president of the company that has developed it. \"I wanted a car that could fly and drive ,but it is difficult to find an organization prepared to insure the vehicle against accidents.\nNevertheless?the company hopes to produce and deliver its first flying car soon. The company already has orders for 40 of them. The majority the potential customers are older and some are retired. There have even been orders from some people who have no pilot's license.\nThe flying car will cost around $ 200.000. \"For an airplane,that's a very reasonable price, but for a car, It's quite expensive,\" explains Alan. \"But it just is not possible to make a $ 10,000 flying car yet. \"\nThis latest means of transport will not become a mass-market item in the near future,but in the long term it has the potential to change the way you travel. It will become no more expensive than driving your car on the motorway. Travel time could be reduced by more than half.\nSo the next time you are told to fasten your seat belt, it may be to prepare for take-off.",

Once again I spelt out directions even a blind person could follow. I glanced impatiently at my watch, and waited. Only two hours remained until my flight left--and it was an hour and a half trip to the airport.\nOutside, heavy rains were pouring down. My house was so far north in the city that buses pass only here times a day.\nThe telephone rang again. \"Terribly sorry,\" began the man at the taxi company. Then I realized that the taxi company, flooded with calls, could only offer in-city runs. I had heard this happens when the weather gets bad. I shouted into the phone that I had a plane to catch and I would meet the taxi outside my house.\nStanding in the wind-driven rain, I looked up and down the road. No taxi. A car went by, the driver and passenger staring at the crazy foreigner in the downpour.\nFinally a white car appeared and pulled to a stop. A young man threw open the door, waving for me to get in. Shaking with cold and anger, I climbed in.\nIn the most polite Japanese, the man said he was called Mike, with who I had spoken three times that morning. He had left his post in the office and raced here in his personal car. He apologized again, but didn't explain why a taxi would not pick me up. Delivering me straight to the airport, he refused the 2,000 yen I pressed into his hand.\nA few hours later, as the storm-delayed 727 took off, I opened the newspaper. On the second page my eyes caught the headline of a short article: Taxi Strike Begins This Morning in Kyoto.",

        "passage": "They can be seen more frequently than ever before on college campuses, wearing thick-rimmed glasses while listening to indie  music. One might find them playing unusual musical instruments, shopping at second-hand stores or expressing themselves in other unique ways. They call themselves hipsters. Being \"hip\" used to mean following the latest fashion. But gradually the word has evolved into a synonym for \"cool\".\nHipsters value independent thinking, progressive politics, an appreciation of creativity and intelligence. Hipsters take pains and pride in not being mainstream. However, their culture has become quite trendy. This irony is central to their culture and offers an interesting paradox.\n\"I do take things in the mainstream with a grain of salt,\" says Ben Polson, a college student at Brown University in the US. Polson describes himself as a hipster and says he often questions what determines popularity, especially regarding music.When lesser-known bands become popular they often lose their former fan base in exchange for a new one. There is a famous hipster saying that goes: I used to like that band before it got popular.\nAccording to Polson, bands' music changes when they go mainstream. They become \"less experimental, doing things just to save popularity and fans. The original elements that we were drawn to slowly _ for the sake of popularity.\"\nMany young adults have started to view hipsters' outlook as cool and are adopting their counterculture mindset  themselves. This has led to specialized brands, stores and music for the hipster position. Ironically, some such stores, including clothing labels Urban Outfitters and American Apparel, have gained mainstream popularity. This has seemingly diluted  the anti-mainstream culture.\n\"A lot of people that are self-defined hipsters aren't really hipsters, they're just trying to conform to the non-conformist  to seem cooler,\" says Amanda Leopold, a college student from Oberlin College, US. Although Leopold has many unconventional tastes and seems quite individualist, she refuses to classify herself as a hipster.\nThere is a conflict among hipsters about the very definition of the label. To some, to be a hipster is to be free from cultural constraints. To others, it means wearing a certain style and listening to a specific style of music. The former constantly strives for uniqueness, while the latter strives not to be mainstream.\nAnd yet, the movement is gaining mainstream popularity. \"It's kind of the trend these days; _ \" says Leopold. \"There have been hipsters since the seventies. It's only become popular recently.\"\nHipsters reject materialism and laugh at mainstream culture. But are they really beyond material comforts? Do they have any ideas of their own if they despise mainstream so much?\nChristy Wampole, an associate professor of literature at Princeton University, US, is not so sure. She says the hipster is a contradiction in himself and an easy target of mockery . Writing in The New York Times, Wampole paints a less appreciative picture of a typical hipster.\n\"The hipster is a scholar of social forms, a student of cool. He studies continuously, searching for what has yet to be found by the mainstream. He is a walking citation ; his clothes refer to much more than themselves. He tries to negotiate the age-old problem of individuality, not with concepts, but with material things.\"",

Chocolate   drink was first made from the seeds of the cacao   tree by South American Indians. The Spanish introduced it to the rest of the world during the 1500s. And although it was very expensive, it quickly became popular, In London, shops where chocolate drinks were served became important places. Some still exist today. The potato is also from the New World. Around 1600, the Spanish brought it from Peru to Europe, where it soon was widely grown. Ireland became so dependent   on it that thousands of Irish people starved   when the crop failed during the years of 1845--1846, and thousands more were forced to go to live in America.\nThere are many other foods that have traveled from South America to the Old World. But some others went in the opposite direction. Brazil is now the world's largest grower of coffee, and coffee is an important crop in other South American countries. But it is native to Ethiopia. It was first made into a drink by Arabs during the 1400s. According to an Arabic story, coffee was discovered when a goat keeper named Lakdi noticed that his goats were eating red fruits on a coffee tree.

In many areas, this light makes it difficult or impossible to observe stars and planets in the night sky.\nThere are a number of reasons why light pollution is important. One has become clear at the Mount Wilson Observatory near Los Angeles, California. Today, light from Los Angeles makes the night sky above Mount Wilson very bright. It is no longer an important reasearch center because of light pollution.\nLight pollution threatens to reduce the scientific value of research telescoples in other important observatories. They include Lick Observatory near San Jose, California and Yerkes Observatory near Chicago, Illionis.\nLight pollution is the result of wasted energy. Bright light that shines into the sky is not being used to provide light where it is needed on Earth. Poorly designed lighting causes a great deal of light pollution. Lights that are brighter than necessary also cause light pollution.\nMost people in America are surprised to find out that they are able to see our own galaxy ,the Milky Way, with their own eyes.

        "passage": "Should doctors ever lie to benefit their patient---to speed recovery or to cover the coming of death? In medicine as in law, government, and other lines of work, the requirements of honesty often seem dwarfed   by greater needs: the need to protect from brutal news or to uphold a promise of secrecy; to advance the public interest.\nWhat should doctors say, for example, to a 46-year-old man coming in for a routine physical check up just before going on vacation with his family who, though he feels in perfect health, is found to have a form of cancer that will cause him to die within six months. Is it best to tell him the truth? If he asks, should the doctor reject that he is ill, or minimize the gravity of the illness? Should they at least hide the truth until after the family vacation?\nDoctors face such choices often. At times, they see important reasons to lie for the patient's own sake; in their eyes, such lies differ sharply from self-serving ones.\nStudies show that most doctors sincerely believe that the seriously ill patients do not want to know the truth about their condition, and that informing them risks destroying their hope, so that they may recover more slowly, or deteriorate   faster, perhaps even commit suicide.\nBut other studies show that, contrary to the belief of many physicians; a great majority of patients do want to be told the truth, even about serious illness, and feel cheated when they learn that they have been misled. We are also learning that truthful information, humanly conveyed, helps patients cope this illness: help them tolerate pain better, need less medicine, and even recover faster after operation.\nThere is urgent need to debate this issue openly. Not only in medicine, but in other professions as well, practitioners may find themselves repeatedly in difficulty where serious consequences seem avoidable only through deception  . Yet the public has every reason to know professional deception, for such practices are peculiarly likely to become deeply rooted, to spread, and to trust. Neither in medicine, nor in law, government, or the social sciences can there be comfort in the old saying, \"What you don't know can't hurt you.\"",

Society is brainwashing young people into believing that being thin is important and necessary.\nDiet commercials are constantly appearing on our television screens telling us that once we lose weight, we will be happy.

But fast forward to the present, you will find no difficulty in choosing from array  of vivid colors in the market.\nWe also gave our guests a list of keywords--traditional brands, jeans, DIY, international brands, personal dress for them to choose from in order to represent the fashion of their generation. We find out that for every keyword our guest chose, there was a special story behind it. Some of the stories brought us back to old times--we even brought some vintage  clothing from the 60s and 70s up on stage and invited some audience members to try them on.\nWhen we mention fashion, we must mention brand.

The typical person said that he / she read four books in the last year and, excluding those who had not read any books at all, the usual number of books read was seven.\nOf those who did read, women and pensioners   were the most eager readers, and religious works and popular fiction were the top choices. The number of books read was nine books for women and five for men. The number also showed that those with college degrees read the most, and people aged 50 and over read more than those who are younger.\nPeople from the West and Midwest are more likely to have read at least one book in the past year. Southerners who do read tend to read more books -- mostly religious books and romance novels -- than people from other regions.\nThose who said they never attend religious services read nearly twice as many books as those who attend frequently, but the Bible and religious works were read by two thirds of the people in the survey, more than all the other categories. Popular fiction, histories, biographies and mysteries took up about half, while one in five read romance novels. Politics, poetry and classical literature were named by fewer than 5% of readers. More women than men read every major category of books except for history and biography books. Men tend to prefer non-fiction.\nBook sales in the US have been flat in recent years and are expected to stay that way, which, experts think, results from competition from the Internet and other media, and the unsteady economy.",

Five years later, while fighting Patsy Cardiff at Minneapolis, Sullivan broke his right arm in the third round, but he continued fighting to the sixth round and won. In 1889, Sullivan defeated Jade Kilrain with his bare fists in another championship fight, winning twenty thousand dollars and a diamond prize medal. His admirers talked then of running him for the next governor, but he traveled to Australia for a boxing tour instead, coming back only to lose his title in a twenty-one-round match with a young Californian named James J. Corbett.\n\"Gentleman James\" victory in this match marked a turning point, for it showed scientific boxing was over strength.

        "passage": "High Speed Book Scanner\nSimply turning pages of a book quickly may not seem like the best way to scan it. A Japanese research group at Tokyo University has created new software that allows hundreds of pages to be scanned within minutes. Scanning text is normally a boring process with each page having to be inserted into a scanner, but the team led by Professor Masatoshi Ishikawa uses a high speed camera that takes 500 pictures a second to scan pages as they are turned by workers.\nNormal scanners can only scan the information that is actually before them on the page. This high speed book scanner uses a camera that captures pages at 1000fps as they are turned. A system built in allows it to automatically correct any changes to the text due to the page bending as well as light differences due to shadows. \"It takes a shot of the shape, then it calculates the shape and uses those calculations to film the scanning,\" Ishikawa said, explaining the system used to reconstruct the original page.\nThe current system is able to scan an average 250-page book in a little over 60 seconds using basic computer hardware. While it now requires extra time to process the scanned images  , the researchers hope to eventually make the technology both faster and much smaller. \"In the more distant future, once it becomes possible to put all of this processing on one chip   and then put that in an iPad or iPod, one could scan just using that chip. At that point, it becomes possible to scan something quickly to save for later reading,\" Ishikawa said.\nBeing able to scan books with an iPhone may be further off, but Ishikawa says that a commercial version of the large-scale computer based scanning system could be available in two or three years. While the technology has the potential to take paper books into the digital age,\n.",

And then the final one about enabling environment - what do older people think about the environment that they live in.\"  \n\"The focus on the report this year is on pensions - on retirement income that older men and women can expect.\" The index reports only one in four older people over 65 in low and middle income countries have any kind of retirement saving. Norway gets the highest ranking in the index. Rounding out the top 10 are Sweden, Switzerland, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Iceland, the United States, Japan and New Zealand. Afghanistan is at the bottom of the list following many years of conflict. There are 10 African countries on the index - all near the bottom. South Africa ranks the highest among them at 80. However, Porter said South Africa is doing some positive things. \"We've seen some very encouraging public statements from some senior politicians in South Africa that they recognize the contribution and the importance of supporting their older population. South Africa is one of the so-called BRICS nations - countries with strong emerging economies. Other members include Brazil, ranked 58 - Russia, ranked 65 - India, 69 and China, 48. Porter said, \"A lot of the impetus  behind China introducing pension provision for all of her older citizens was to provide an motivation for them to start using their purchasing power earlier in their lives in spending money rather than saving it for a pension.\" Help Age International recommended African nations begin providing pensions when people turn 60. However, if countries are poor, they might not be able to institute a pension system to every eligible  person at once. Another factor is Africa's youth population, which is much greater than most parts of the world. Therefore, governments are already hard pressed to provide education and jobs.",

As we talked, I saw Stephen's eyes getting big with fear.\nI told him to do all of his assignments, and to hand them in on time. Rather than being overwhelmed  by all of the work, I told him the most successful students made a master calendar of all the assignments so they could plan their workload.\nAs the fall semester went on, I learned more of Stephen's story. It had taken him longer to finish the assignments than most young people. Family members , including his mother ,kept reminding him that he was a failure. But he kept at it and didn't take them to heart. He told me that before coming to our college, no one believed he could manage it.\nStephen didn't become an A student. Still, he managed to pass all of his courses by being in class every day, turning in all of his assignments on time and breaking down his study into bite-sized parts. By passing course after course he began to gain a measure of self-esteem.\nOn his graduation day, he walked up to me, and said \"Thank you.\"",

Why do we blame the black cat when we saw the low score of the test?\nThese habits have been referred to as magical thinking and can be found everywhere in daily life. For example, a person wishes something bad for an annoying colleague. Or parents pray for a safe fight when seeing their son off. \nPsychologically helpful\nIn examining these habits, scientists decided to search for a reason for humans' belief in magical powers. Psychologists have their own approach to the question. \n\"I think in part it's because we are constantly exposed to our own thoughts, and thus likely to overestimate their connection to outside events. \"said Emily Pronin, a psychologist in the prefix = st1 /US.\nFor people who are uncertain of their own abilities or slow to take action, magical thinking can be a great help, explained Dr. Daniel Wegner, a professor psychology at Harvard. Feeling that their own thoughts can control things can help people fight depression. \nA trait gained through evolution\nBut evolutionists have their own ideas. \nTwo schools of evolutionary thought have come up with reasons by analyzing the development of humans. They are the \"adaptationists \"and the \"byproduct theorists \". \nThe adaptationists say that belief in magical powers makes people feel better, less worried about difficulties, more focused on the future, and more willing to care for themselves. People with a strong faith (in something) have a better chance of surviving a tough environment or competition. \nBut in byproduct theory,magical thinking is a product of our psychological features. \n\"We automatically look for an explanation of why things happen,\"explains Justin Barrett, a psychologist, The brain, therefore, has evolved to make quick judgments about causation . So we often link two events based on nothing more than coincidence. For example, \"I was just thinking about looking up my old high school girlfriend when she suddenly called me. \"\nAnother psychological feature is the theory of mind. We recognize that there could be an unseen power of mind affecting the outcome of an incident. \nByproduct theorists claim that because of these features, we are born with a tendency to believe in our magical thinking. \nBut we need to confine our magical thinking, warn psychologists. \nFor most people, beliefs are just some sort of comforting private ritual. When something important is at stake, such as a test or a performance or a relationship, people don't simply perform their private rituals. They have to prepare.",

        "passage": "Recreational tree climbing is taking root in the ecotourism industry, and it's sending guys like Tim Kovar to far off reaches of the globe. Kovar, a tree-climbing instructor, recently returned to the U.S. from Brazil, where he spent time developing a tree-climbing operation thanks to the \"slow travel\" movement.\n   Slow travel, is like the slow food movement, the practice of giving fast food in favor of homegrown cooking--the kind that takes hours to prepare and enjoy. Likewise, slow travel urges visitors to experience a place's natural surroundings and learn about the ecology in a way not afforded by extreme games. \n   \"Tree climbing is a slow activity,\" says Kovar. \"It's not something you do quickly and then you're on to the next thing or event.\" There is no such thing as a quick climb, especially for beginners. This wasn't a race against the clock or the fellow climbers. In fact, tree climbing is unlikely to ever become a feature of the extreme games. Many climbers refuse competition. There has already been so much competition in the world.\n\"When you stand below the tree, it can be amazing,\" Rusel DeMaria says, looking affectionately up at Michael's Triumph, a 150-foot-tall tree. But reaching the treetop, he adds, is an entirely different feeling. Likewise, his wife, Viola Brumbaugh, kneels on the ground and asks Michael's Triumph for permission to climb. \"It goes a lot smoother that way, \"She says.\nAnd climbing has been included into many educational programs. New Tribe offers guided climbs through its school, Tree Climbing Northwest, where \"we teach enough tree biology and forest ecology to raise awareness in our students,\" says New Tribe present Sophis Sparks. \"We know that the tree climbing experience deepens personal appreciation for trees. After climbing, people value trees more and are motivated to support preservation. This is not just to preserve their playground.\"\n   Perhaps that is why he struggles with the term \"recreational tree climbing,\" saying, \"I prefer to call it inspirational tree climbing.\"",

On the same day, a Nepali   man, Apa Sherpa, broke his own world record of climbing Everest when he reached the summit for the twentieth time. Apa Shepa's team set off from Nepal's capital, Kathmandu, last month, heading for the base camp on the Chinese side of the mountain.\n\"The team has just called in and believe that they are standing on top of Mt. Everest,\" Romero's blog said. \"Their dreams have now come true. Everyone is happy.\"\nThe climbing has put Romero one step closer to reaching his goal of climbing the highest mountains on all seven continents  . \"It is just a goal.\" Romero said. He had already climbed five peaks  , and needs to climb only Vinson Massif, the highest peak in Antarctica, to hit his goal.\nThe youngest person before to climb Everest was 16-year-old Temba Tsheri Sherpa of Nepal. Romero climbed together with a team including his father Paul and three local guides. He wanted to pick a small piece of rock from the top of the world and wear it in a necklace. While Nepal insists that anyone planning to climb Mount Everest must be at least 16, China does not have any age restrictions  .

In winter, with its cloudy days and bitter cold, we dream of those days at the beach, lying on the sand and enjoying the bright and burning sun. And then, summer comes, and it rains.\nAs a child, I would wake up to rainy summer days and come close to crying. It wasn't fair. We suffered through months of school and experienced bad weather for those short ten weeks of freedom.\nOn those rainy summer days, I had nothing fun to do and could only sit inside, staring out at the rain like a bird in a cage. I was an only child, so there was no one else to play with. My father worked from home, so I was not truly alone, but he could not actively play with me since he was at work. It was those days that I would watch whatever was on television or read any books that I could find lying around. I'd pray each night that the rain would not be there the next day.\nAs an adult, though, my opinion of summer rain has changed. When you have to work every day, summer is not as exciting. Everything seems uninteresting. Such a mindset makes you cheer for anything new or different. I spend the winter dreaming of summer and the summer dreaming of winter. When summer comes, I hate how hot it is. And then I look forward to the rain, because the rain brings with it a cold front, which makes me comfortable.

He grew up having other kittens to play and socialize with, and was used to people from the moment he was born since there are always kids hanging around the barn. He was a favorite amongst the students at the barn. However, when it came time to find the kittens homes, no one knew where Jack would end up. That's when I got an e-mail from my friend. All she asked was \"Do you still want one of the kittens? There's one here with no eyes and no one can take him.\" Without thinking I told her that I did want the kitten.\nWhen we first brought him home Jack walked cautiously around, sniffing everything. He went through a time when he could climb the stairs, but couldn't get down. He would sit at the top and cry until someone came and got him. Every now and then when he gets disoriented he'll stop and cry. But we just call his name and talk to him and it isn't long before he finds his way back to us.\nAlso, a few weeks after getting Jack, we got a new barn cat named Bear. I always take Jack outside at that time for some fresh air and exercise. He loves to run (at top speed!) around the backyard and gardens. Bear and Jack have become best friends. Jack always knows when Bear is around. He'll run across the yard straight to Bear and wrap his front legs around his neck in a big hug. When they're tired they'll lie down in the grass together.\nJack is truly an inspiration. I've owned a lot of kittens in my life, but Jack is the happiest, most playful of them all. People who know Jack don't feel sorry for him. They cherish him for the treasure that he is. I have talked to a few people who haven't met him personally and tend to pity him, but they just don't understand. Jack doesn't need pity.

But go in winter to all you'll find is a pool of water, because the hotel melts every spring!\nThe man who runs the Artic Hall Hotel is Nils Yngve Bergqvist. He built his first ice building for an art exhibition in 1991 and he designed the present hotel-over 200 meters square-himself. It took workmen about two months to pile 1,000 tons of snow onto a wooden base. As the weather got colder, the snow froze and then they removed the base. The whole building and everything in it are made of snow-except for the wooden front door. There's a theatre which Nils uses for a jazz club, a radio station and a large ice bar. As you can imagine, hot drinks are popular with the guests! The rooms have no doors; there's no furniture, no heating and everyone sleeps on ice beds. But the 800 people who stayed at the hotel this winter seemed to like it. If you want to stay in one of he ten ice rooms, it will cost you about Y=30 a night. You will receive a survival certificate from the manager.\nWhen the winter's over, Nils holds his annual contest to predict the day that the hotel will fall. The person that guessed the day correctly last year received a large painting from an Artic Hall exhibition. Nils' ice hotel is becoming world famous and he loves his work. He's already excited about his next project-an ice hotel that will have more complicated architectural features and, he says, will be bigger and better.",

You are a nice little boy!\" she said kindly, smiling.\nA special feeling came to him. These were the first kind words he had ever heard. He watched her until she went far away, and then he whistled to his dog and went directly to the river nearby.\n\"Thank you, dear! You are a nice little boy\" he repeated the woman's words. Then in a low voice he said to his dog, \"You are a nice little dog!\" Tiger raised its ears as if it understood.\n\"Unum! Even a dog likes it!\" he said. \"Well, Tiger, I won't say unkind words to you any more.\" Tiger waved its tail happily.\nThe boy thought and thought. Finally he looked at himself in the river. He saw nothing but a dirty boy. He washed his face carefully. Again he looked. He saw a clean nice boy. He was amazed. From then on, he had a new life.\nAfter telling this, the businessman stopped for a while, and then he said, \"Ladies and gentlemen, this is the very place where that kind woman planted in me the first seed of kindness.

The material's inventors say it has a number of possible uses and someday could provide a more environmentally friendly alternative to plastic. The material, made from shrimp (') shells and proteins produced from silk, is called \"shrilk.\" It is thin, clear, flexible and strong.\nA major benefit of the material is its biodegradability. Plastic's toughness and flexibility represented a revolution in materials science during the 1950s and '60s. Decades later, however, plastic's very durability   is raising questions about how appropriate it is for one-time products such as plastic bags, or short-lived consumer goods, used in the home for a few years and then cast into a landfill where they will degrade for centuries. What is the point of making something that lasts 1,000 years?\nShrilk not only will degrade in a landfill, but its basic components are used as fertilizer , and so will enrich the soil.\nShrilk has great potential, the inventors said. Materials from which it is made are plentiful in nature, found in everything ranging from shrimp shells, insect bodies to living plants. That makes shrilk low cost, and its mass production possible should it be used for products demanding a lot of material.\nWork on shrilk is continuing in the lab. The inventors said the material becomes flexible when wet, so they're exploring ways to use it in wet environments. They're also developing simpler production processes, which could be used for non-medical products, like for computer cases and other products inside the home. They're even exploring combining it with other materials, like carbon fibers, to give it new properties.",

It's important to do so in a proper way, no matter whether you are introducing yourself to someone, or introducing two people. To keep you aware of this, we have gathered tips on how to make a proper introduction.\n*Always stand when making an introduction.\nWhen you are seated and someone comes up to greet you, make the effort to stand up. By doing this, you show respect for yourself and for the other person.\n*Always keep eye contact while making an introduction.\nMany people are not aware of the value of this simple action. When you make eye contact, you are giving a confident image.\n*Always introduce a person of lesser authority to one of greater authority. The most important thing to remember is to say the most important person's name first.\nFor example, when introducing your supervisor to a job candidate  , you would give your supervisor's name first. \"Bob Jones, may I introduce Susan Lee, who has just graduated from ABC University?\"\n*In a situation where rank is unimportant, an introduction is based on sex and age. A man is presented to a woman and a younger woman to an older woman.\nWhat if you find yourself in a situation where you have forgotten the other person's name? Start with a handshake and reintroduce   yourself. When doing this, you will usually cause the other person to do the same.\nHowever, if the other person does not take your suggestion, it is OK simply to apologize and let the person know that you cannot remember her or his name. This is not the ideal situation, of course, but it does happen to all of us. The other person should be forgiving.",

        "passage": "Amazingly, US crime figures have been falling for 20 years now. Of course, the big question is, why? And can any lessons be learnt?\n  One reason could be the fall in the demand for the drug crack. During the 1980s, drug-related crimes soared, mostly caused by desperate crack users. However, according to professor Blumstein, co-author of The Crime Drop in America, news of the dangers of crack use caused its decrease and led to a fall in the number of drug-related crimes.\n  Some say that the adoption of a zero-tolerance policy in many cities has helped lead to a fall in crime. In New York City, for example, mayor Rudy Giuliani imposed strict and automatic punishments for all crimes, including minor offences such as graffiti and littering. Many believe this has had a very strong deterrent  effect.\n  Another reason could be smarter policing strategies. Anti-theft measures and educating the community about car theft has helped see a drop in crimes in many areas. Also, the use of crime mapping schemes that can discover identify crime peaks in different parts of the city has helped police target hotspots.\n  Another reason could be that more criminals are now behind bars. Sociologist John Conklin (from Tufts University) says a significant factor behind the fall in crime in the 1990s is the simple fact that many criminals are in jail. In his book Why Crime Rages Fell, he says sentencing was merciful in the 1960s and 1970s, when crime rose. But then more prisons were built and more offenders were imprisoned.\n  Some have linked the fall in violent crime to a decline in children's exposure to lead in petrol. Jessica Wolpaw Reyes says, \"Even low to moderate levels of exposure can lead to behavioral problems, reduced IQ, hyperactivity  and youth crimes. You can link the decline in lead between 1975 and 1985 to a decline in violent crime 20 years later.\"\n  Others say that the drop in crime has something to do with birth rates. According to statistics, birth rates peaked between 1957 and 1961, and the proportion of men in the US in their late teens and early 20s (the so-called \"criminal age\") was highest in the late 70s and early 80s. However, as time went on, the proportion of people in this age group decreased. \n  Others claim that videogames have helped. A recent study has suggested that these games are keeping young people off the streets and therefore away from crime. Advocates of this argue that any effects the games may have in encouraging violent behavior is  _ by the fact that the games keep potential criminals indoors and in front of the television.\n  Some argue that the widespread use of camera phones makes some criminals think twice before committing a crime and getting filmed doing it. Also, many believe that the mass use of CCTV has also had an effect.\n  Finally, some say that petty theft just isn't worth it any more. The resale value of second-hand goods such as televisions, cameras or clothes is now so low (or even non-existent) that most people see no point in stealing. \n  So, what do you think?",

During the competition the students must work together as a team and think spontaneously and creatively.\nChengdu #7 is a key High School in the fields of science and mathematics. This is the first time they have had an opportunity to attend the Odyssey of the MindWorld Competition. For the seven team members and three coaches (teachers) it will be the first time to visit theUnited States. It will cost each student approximately 20,000 RMB for the twelve-day trip. They have been working hard for this opportunity for a year.\nTraditionally businesses have supported Odyssey of the Mindbecause it produces students who can work as a team and solve problems creatively. We are asking your company for a donation to help defer the expenses for these deserving students. Please make out checks toChengdu#7 and specify Odyssey of the Mind. Any amount you can contribute will be greatly appreciated and will help us to continue to prepare our students for tomorrow's world. \nSincerely yours,\nChengdu #7 High School \n#1 Linyin St. Chengdu, 610041",

It was more than three hundred and thirty-five million people lack enough water now. The people live in twenty-eight countries. Most of the countries are in Africa or in the Middle East.\nPopulation Action International researcher Robert Engelman says by the year 2025, about three thousand million people lack water. At least 18 more countries are expected to have serious water problems. The demand for water keeps increasing. Yet the amount of water on the earth the same. Mr Engelman says the population in countries that lack water is growing in these countries will continue to increase.\nThe report says lack of water in the future may result several problems. It may increase health problems. Lack of water often means drinking water is not safe. Mr Engelman says there are problems all over the world because of diseases such as cholera that are carried in water.\nLack of water also may result in more international conflict. Countries may have to fight for water in the future. Some countries, such as Syria, Sudan, Cambodia, and so on, now get sixty percent of their fresh water from other countries. And the report says lack of water would affect the ability to improve their economies. This is because industries often need a large amount of water.\nThe Population Action International study gives several ways to solve the water problem. One way is to find ways to use water for more than one purpose. Another way is to teach people to be careful not to waste water. A third is to use less water for agriculture. The report also says long-term solutions to the water problem must include controls on population growth.",

Actually, it may be confirmed as a very crowded place by new computer models developed to help identify habitable planets.\nEstimates of places where life can exist have been based on the possibility of them having surface water. But software recently developed by the Aberdeen University allows researchers to identify planets with underground water kept liquid by heat from planets.\nWater is fundamental for life and planets too close to the sun lose water to the atmosphere through evaporation. On the other hand, planets located in distant reaches from their star have their surface water locked away as ice.\nSean McMahon, who is carrying out the work, explained: \"Traditionally people have said that if a planet is in this Goldilocks zone--not too hot and not too cold--then it can have liquid water on its surface and be habitable.\"\nBut this concept might change when considering that planets can receive two sources of heat--heat direct from the star and heat generated deep inside the planet.\nIt is easy to observe it in our own planet. As you go down through the crust   of the Earth, the temperature gets higher and higher. Even when the surface is frozen, water can exist below ground.\nThere could be immense quantities of water in fact--full of primitive life.\nProfessor John Parnell, also from Aberdeen University said: \"There is a significant habitat for microorganisms below the surface of the Earth, extending down several kilometres\".\n\"And some believe that the majority of life on Earth could even reside in this deep biosphere.\"\nSo the Aberdeen team are developing models to predict which distant planets might harbour underground reservoirs of liquid water with the possibility of alien life.",

        "passage": "\"Family\" is of course an _ word. But when British people say that their society is based on family life, they are thinking of \"family\" in its narrow, peculiarly European sense of mother ,father and children living together alone in their own house as an economic and social unit. Thus, every British marriage indicates the beginning of a new and independent family--hence the tremendous importance of marriage in British life. For both the man and the woman, marriage means leaving one's parents and starting one's own life. The man's first duty will then be to his wife, and the wife's to her husband. He will be entirely responsible for her financial support, and she for the running of the new home. Their children will be their common responsibility and theirs alone. Neither the wife's parents nor the husband's, nor their brothers or sisters, aunts or uncles, have any right to interfere with them--they are their own masters.\nReaders of novels like Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice will know that in former times marriage among wealthy families were arranged by the girl's parents, that is, it was the parents' duty to find a suitable husband for their daughter, preferably a rich one, and by skillful encouragement to lead him eventually to ask their permission to marry her. Until that time, the girl was protected and maintained in the parents' home, and the financial relief of getting rid of her could be seen in their giving the newly married pair a sum of money called a dowry. It is very different today. Most girls of today get a job when they leave school and become financially independent before their marriage. This has had two results. A girl chooses her own husband, and she gets no dowry.",

But its maker, Frito-Lay, thinks otherwise. \"Potato chips are a snack food for the world,\" said Salman Amin, the company's head of global marketing. Amin believes there is no corner of the world that can resist the charms of a Frito-Lay potato chip.\nFrito-Lay is the biggest snack maker in prefix = st1 /Americaowned by PepsiCo and accounts for over half of the parent company's $3 billion annual profits. But theU.S.snack food market is largely saturated, and to grow the company has to look overseas.\nIts strategy rests on two beliefs: first a global product offers economies of scale with which local brands cannot compete. And second, consumers in the 21st century are drawn to \"global\" as a concept. \"Global\" does not mean products that are consciously identified as American, but ones that consumes--especially young people are linked across cultures by shared beliefs and tastes. Potato chips are an American invention, but most Chinese, for instance, do not know that Frito-Lay is an American company. Instead, Riskey, the company's research and development head, would hope they associate the brand with the new world of global communications and business.\nWith brand perception a crucial  factor, Riskey ordered a redesign of the Frito-Lay logo .The logo, along with the company's long-held marketing image of the \"irresistibility\" of its chips would help facilitate the company's global expansion.\nThe executives acknowledge that they try to swing national eating habits to a food created in America, but they deny that amounts to economic imperialism . Rather, they see Frito-Lay as spreading the benefits of free enterprise across the world. \"We're making products in those countries, we're adapting them to the tastes of those countries, building businesses and employing people and changing lives,\" said Steve Reinemund, PepsiCo's chief executive.",

In 2012, the reality talent show , the voice of China, on the Zhejiang Television became the most popular program in China.\nThe reaon for its popularity was really because its excellent quality? Or can we assume that without any opponent, we can't tell a contestant is winning because he is really talented or because there's no comparison?\nThe administrative department really contributed a lot in the popularity of the voice of China. In the past, there was no other draft shows  ranked as high as Super GirlandSuper Boy. Even though there were some draft shows which seemed to share the popularity, it never turned out ture. All the other draft shows were shodowed by the ones on Hunan TV. One example was that since draft shows of Hunan TV were broadcast on Friday night, the draft shows of other stations were shifted to Saturday or Sunday. However, Hunan TV didn't get their permission for broadcasting shows in 2012.\nAnd if this were not bad enough, SARFT did a great favor for it. SARFT issued a regulation, saying that all draft shows should be broadcast after 10:30 pm at night. Zhejiang TV declared long before the regulation that since was \"no audition , no PK, no rise in rank, no voting, no champion\", its program was never a draft show. So, in 2012, all the opponents of Zhejiang TV had to broadcast their draft shows after 10:30 pm while the voice of Chinawas permitted to be broadcast in prime time.\nIf you really think about it, there's no esential different between a draft show and the voice of China. It also selected people from all over the country, how did they say this were different from a draft show? No PK,really? PK doesn't mean one versus one! A team versus a team is called PK too. And \"no rise in rank?\" is just a switch of concepts because at the end of every game, some left the stage and some stayed. If there was really \"no champion\", how come there was only one \"good voice of China\" at the final round? All these were rising in rank, in disguise .\nUnder such cimcumstance, the voice of Chinaeven got praise.

Kovar, a tree-climbing instructor, recently returned to the U.S. from Brazil, where he spent time developing a tree-climbing operation thanks to the \"slow travel\" movement.\n   Slow travel, is like the slow food movement, the practice of giving fast food in favor of homegrown cooking--the kind that takes hours to prepare and enjoy. Likewise, slow travel urges visitors to experience a place's natural surroundings and learn about the ecology in a way not afforded by extreme games. \n   \"Tree climbing is a slow activity,\" says Kovar. \"It's not something you do quickly and then you're on to the next thing or event.\" There is no such thing as a quick climb, especially for beginners. This wasn't a race against the clock or the fellow climbers. In fact, tree climbing is unlikely to ever become a feature of the extreme games. Many climbers refuse competition. There has already been so much competition in the world.\n\"When you stand below the tree, it can be amazing,\" Rusel DeMaria says, looking affectionately up at Michael's Triumph, a 150-foot-tall tree. But reaching the treetop, he adds, is an entirely different feeling. Likewise, his wife, Viola Brumbaugh, kneels on the ground and asks Michael's Triumph for permission to climb. \"It goes a lot smoother that way, \"She says.\nAnd climbing has been included into many educational programs. New Tribe offers guided climbs through its school, Tree Climbing Northwest, where \"we teach enough tree biology and forest ecology to raise awareness in our students,\" says New Tribe present Sophis Sparks. \"We know that the tree climbing experience deepens personal appreciation for trees. After climbing, people value trees more and are motivated to support preservation. This is not just to preserve their playground.\"\n   Perhaps that is why he struggles with the term \"recreational tree climbing,\" saying, \"I prefer to call it inspirational tree climbing.\"",

The gloves are known as \"Talk to the Hand\" and cost PS1,000 a pair. They fixed a speaker unit into the thumb and a microphone into the little finger that can be connected to any mobile handset using Bluetooth.\nArtist Sean Miles designed the new gloves that double as a phone in part of his project that shows the possibilities of gadget(,) recycling. He uses outdated gloves and combines them with parts from mobile handsets recycled through _ , which commissioned the project. Mobile phone users will be able to keep their hands warm while they chat without taking their phones out of their pockets or handbags.\nMr Miles designed two pairs of the new gloves--one in pink and the other in brown and yellow. They will appear in an exhibition this July and visitors will be able to win the gloves. If demand is high, they will then be produced on a larger scale. O2 Recycle, which backed the project, estimates that there are already 70 million unused mobile handsets in the UK. The service pays up to PS260 to those who recycle gadgets including phones, handheld consoles, MP3 players and digital cameras.\nDesigner Sean Miles hopes his work will get people thinking about recycling. The 41-year-old said, \"I hope that my 'Talk to the Hand' project will get people to think again about the waste created by not recycling gadgets. If a few more people recycle their gadgets rather than send them to trash, I think this project will have fulfilled its aim.\"\nBill Eyres, head of O2 Recycle, urges people to recycle their phone responsibly. He said, \"There's a pressing need for all of us to look at outdated handsets, and all the gadgets that we move on from or upgrade each year. Whether they are consoles or cameras, we should think of them as a resource that we need to recycle responsibly rather than throw them away.\"",

        "passage": "Everyone, please think of your biggest personal goal. For real - you can take a second. You've got to feel this to learn it. Take a few seconds and think of your personal biggest goal, okay? Imagine deciding right now that you're going to do it. Imagine telling someone that you meet today what you're going to do. Imagine their congratulations and their high image   of you. Doesn't it feel good to say it out loud? Don't you feel one step closer already, like it's already becoming part of your identity?\nWell, bad news: you should have kept your mouth shut, because that good feeling now will make you less likely to do it. Repeated psychology tests have proved that telling someone your goal makes it less likely to happen. Any time you have a goal, there are some steps that need to be done, some work that needs to be done in order to achieve it. Ideally, you would not be satisfied until you had actually done the work. But when you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it, psychologists have found that it's called a \"social reality\". The mind is kind of tricked into feeling that it's already done. And then, because you felt that satisfaction, you're less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary. So, this goes against the conventional wisdom that we should tell our friends our goals.\nPeter Gollwitzer wrote a whole book about this and in 2009, he did some new tests that were published.\n    It goes like this: 163 people across four separate tests - everyone wrote down their personal goals.Then, half of them announced their commitment to this goal to the room, and half didn't. Then everyone was given 45 minutes of work that would directly lead them toward their goals, but they were told that they could stop at any time. Now, those who kept their mouths shut worked the entire 45 minutes, on average, and when asked afterward, said that they felt that they had a long way to go to still achieve their goals. But those who had announced it quit after only 33 minutes, on average, and when asked afterward, said that they felt much closer to achieving their goals.\nSo audience, next time you want to tell someone your goal, what will you say?

        "passage": "Train-spotting\nMany people around the world have seen Danny Boyle's movie Train spotting starring Ewan McGregor, but how many of us really know what train-spotting is all about? Now this is not considered cool in town and the word \"train-spotter\" in Britain is related to \"geek\" or \"nerd\" (someone who seems very ridiculous). But is this reputation really deserved?\nFirst of all, let's see what train-spotting is. It is said that there are some 100,000 train spotters in the UK. Exactly as the title suggests, they spot trains, that is, they stand in train stations, look at the number of each train that leaves and arrives and write it down. The eventual aim is to have seen every train in the country.\nBeing crazy about railways and trains is not modern and it dates back to 1804. As the number of trains grew and they got faster and faster, so did the interest in them grow? Is this any stranger than people who love cars?\nSo, what do you need to be a train-spotter? Well, all you really need is a pen or pencil and a notebook to write down the train numbers. Other equipment  includes hot tea in a thermos, a camera and some sandwiches for those long afternoons spent on train platforms when you don't want to risk the delights of railway station food.\nIt's interesting to note that despite the \"bad name\" of train-spotting, there have been famous railway lovers in history, such as Alfred Hitchcock, who filmed them regularly, especially The 39 Steps. There is evidence, too, that being a train-spotter is not necessarily a strange phenomenon in Britain.\nOne glance at the US train stations should be enough to convince you that train-spotters there are alive and well. In America, they try to call rail lovers \"train-fans\" and talk of \"train-fanning\". Don't let this fool you--these people are train spotters and there are a lot of them.

Your genes control how fast or how long your hair will grow.Some people have a longer than usual anagen growth period.These people may be able to grow more hair than the average person.\nHowever, others struggle to grow shoulder length hair.These people have a shorter than normal anagen period.\nYour health can also affect hair growth.Poor nutrition can cause some hair follicles to stop growing or cause the hairs that grow to become weak or thin.Problems with hair growth can result from thyroid (^?K JSO problems or other conditions.Health experts say people who experience a sudden increase in hair loss should seek medical advice.",

Before I became a morning bus assistant, I'd heard that Michael was a challenging student who would always shout, stand up on the bus, make fun of other students, and distract bus driver. So I decided that each morning, when he got on the bus, I'd have Michael sit beside me. At first he didn't like this idea and pouted about it. But soon he settled down, knowing he had no choice. I began to talk to him about little things outside of school life, such as his weekend activities and things that he liked to do. I also listened closely to him When he talked and thoroughly responded to his ideas. As I gave Michael the attention that he needed,little by little, he began to behave better and better. His transformation was noticed by all, by the students and especially the bus driver.\nAnother student I took a special interest in was a boy named Tony, a third grader. To some, Tony seemed to be a slow or passive learner. So I decided to see if I could find a way to motivate Tony to stay on the task. I would sit in the seat next to him and encourage him through every step of the work he was doing. This helped him to stay motivated and at least the work was getting down on time. Before long, he was paying more attention to his studies, and scoring high on all his tests. I knew that all Tony had needed was to be motivated on a one-on-one basis.",

Visitors have fallen to around 3 million a year from 3.5 million since Ling Ling's death.\nSince a boat collision near the Diaoyu Islands in September, Sino-Japanese relations have been at a low point.

        "passage": "Choosing the Right Resolution  \nMillions of Americans began 2014 with the same resolution they started 2013 with, a goal of losing weight. However, setting weight loss as a goal is a mistake.\nTo reach our goal of losing weight --- the output, we need to control what we eat --- the input ( ). That is, we tend to care about the output but not to control the input. This is a bad way to construce goals. The alternative is to focus your resolution on the input. Instead of resolving to lose weight, try an actionable resolution: \"I'll stop having desert for lunch,\" or \"I'll walk every day for 20 minutes.\" Creating a goal that focuses on a well-specified input will likely be more effective than concentrating on the outcome.\nRecently a new science behind incentives   , including in education, has been discussed. For example, researcher Roland Fryer wanted to see what works best in motivating children to do better in school. In some cases, he gave students incentives based on input, like reading certain books, while in others, the incentives were based on output, like results on exams. His main finding was that incentives increased achievement when based on input but had no effect on output. Fryer's conclusion was that the intensives for inputs might be more effective because do not knoe how to do better on exam, aside from general rules like \"study harder.\" Reading certain books, on the other hand, is a well-set task over which they have much more control.\nAs long as you have direct control over your goal, you have a much higher chance of success. And it's easier to start again if you fail, because you know exactly what you need to do.\nIf you want to cut down on your spending, a good goal would be making morning coffee at home instead of going to a cafe, for example. This is a well-specified action-based goal for which you can measure your success easily. Spending less money isn't a goal because it's too general. Similarly, if you want to spend more time with your family, don't stop with this general wish. Think bout an actionable habit that you could adopt and stick to, like a family movie night every Wednesday.\nIn the long run, these new goals could become a habit.",

        "passage": "Music education hasn't changed much since the 1970s. Students are still taught to read notation so they can recite compositions that they would never listen to on their MP3 players or play with friends. Playing music enriches life. The question is: Why do schools teach music in a way that _ so many young people rather than catch their imagination? Can we do a better job of using the power of music to get kids excited about school?\nThe experience of an organization called Little Kids Rock suggests the answer is yes -- if we change the way music is taught. Little Kids Rock has helped music programs in over a thousand public schools and served 150,000 children. The organization has given 30,000 free instruments out, mainly guitars, and trained 1,500 teachers to run music classes in which students quickly experience the joys of playing their favorite songs, performing in bands , and writing their own music.\nThe key to Little Kids Rock is that it teaches children to play music the way many musicians learn to play it -- not by notation, but by listening, imitation and meaningful experimentation. \"The knowledge you need to get started playing rock music is very limited,\" explains Dave Wish, the founder of Little Kids Rock. \"In high school, my friend Paul taught me a couple of chords and my life was changed forever. On the first day of class, Little Kids Rock teachers place guitars in the hands of their students and get them practicing chords that will enable them to play thousands of songs. The kids decide what songs they want to learn and the class is off and running. Their progress is surprising. Within a year, eight and nine-year-olds are playing musical instruments, and giving concerts, even performing their own songs.\nOne of the biggest advantages that music offers is the ability to encourage students who are otherwise bored by school. \"I've had students start coming back to school because of this program,\" said Adkison Thomas, who heads up music for the Dallas Independent School District. He added, \"One of the best things is that the teachers discover a new side of their students. They see kids become successful who weren't before.\"",

        "passage": "I was brought up in the British, _ . Strong feelings aren't something you display in public. So, you can imagine that I was unprepared for the outpouring of public grief  at a Chinese funeral.\nMy editorial team leader died recently after a short illness. He was 31. The news was so unexpected that it left us all shocked and upset. A female colleague burst into tears and cried piteously at her desk. Somehow we got through the day's work. The next day was the funeral.\nOur big boss stepped forward to deliver a eulogy and was soon in tears. She carried on, in Chinese of course, but at the end said in English: \"There will be no more deadlines for you in heaven.\" Next came a long-term colleague who also dissolved in tears but carried on with her speech despite being almost overcome by emotion. Then a close friend of the dead man paid tribute , weeping openly as he spoke. Sorrow is spreading. Me and women were now sobbing uncontrollably. Finally, the man's mother, supported between two women, addressed her son in his coffin. At one point, the mother almost collapsed and had to be held up. We were invited to step forward to each lay a white rose on the casket. Our dead colleague looked as if he was taking a nap. At the end of the service I walked away from the funeral parlor stunned at the outpouring of emotion.\nIn the UK, families grieve privately and then try to hold it together and not break down at a funeral. Here in China it would seem that grieving is a public affair. It strikes me that it is more cathartic to cry your eyes out than try to keep it bottled up for fear of embarrassment, which is what many of us do in the West.\nAfterwards, a Chinese colleague told me that the lamenting at the funeral had been restrained  by Chinese standards. In some rural areas, she said, people used to be paid to mourn noisily. This struck me like something out of novel by Charles Dickens. But we have all seen on TV scenes of grief-stricken people in Gaza and the West Bank, in Afghanistan, Iraq and the relatives of victims of terrorist bombings around the world. Chinese grief is no different. I realized that it's the reserved British way of mourning that is out of step with the rest of the world.\nIt was our newspaper's production day. We were bussed back to the office to resume work. No more deadlines for our former colleague, but we had to pull together to put the newspaper to print. The boss invited the team to go out for dinner after work. We relaxed, smiled, joked. There was no mention of the funeral or our poor colleague. Enough sorrow had been shed already. We needed a break.",

        "passage": "Grown-ups are often surprised by how well they remember something they learned as children but have never practiced ever since. A man who has not had a chance to go swimming for years can still swim as well as ever when he gets back in the water. He can get on a bicycle after many years and still ride away. He can play catch and hit a ball as well as his son. A mother who has not thought about the words for years can teach her daughter the poem that begins \"Twinkle, twinkle, little star\" or remember the story of Cinderella or Goldilocks and the Three Bears.\nOne explanation is the law of overlearning, which can be stated as follows: Once we have learned something, additional learning trials increase the length of time we will remember it.\nIn childhood we usually continue to practice such skills as swimming, bicycle riding, and playing baseball long after we have learned them. We continue to listen to and remind ourselves of words such as \"Twinkle, twinkle, little star\" and childhood tales such as Cinderella and Goldilocks. We not only learn but overlearn.\nThe multiplication tables are an exception to the general rule. that we forget rather quickly the things that we learn in school, because they are another of the things we overlearn in childhood. The law of overlearning explains why cramming  for an examination, though it may result in a passing grade, is not a satisfactory way to learn a college course. By cramming, a student may learn the subject well enough to get by on the examination, but he is likely soon to forget almost everything he learned. A little overlearning, on the other hand, is really necessary for one's future development",

And the writer John Updike, who died last month, started using computers in the 1980s, Winterkorn pointed out, so his \"papers\" will include a big store of electronic documents.\nSo far, however, digital archives have been traded as just a small part of a larger, mainly paper-based archive.

This past year has been one of the hardest for me. I felt I was stuck in a position that had nothing to do with what I wanted to do with my life. In January, after two years of being together, my boyfriend left me.\nI read your blog every morning as I drink my coffee at work, but it wasn't until this March that I told myself \"no more negativity\" as you taught readers in your blog.\nSince then I've got into new habits at work to keep my energy positive. When people walk in the front door, I'm the first face they see, so I smile big when I say \"good morning\" to them, especially on Mondays. Instead of waiting for someone to ask me for help, I offer it with an open mind. The CEO noticed my change and offered me the executive assistant position that I wanted.\nOne of the biggest things I've taken to heart from your blog is changing my opinions on my job. Yes, it was not an important position, but when I was passionate   about it, I could make my life fulfilling.\nAll in all, I have to thank you somehow for having the passion to help others because it truly is inspiring to me. So thank you so much, John. My life has changed because your words pointed me in the right direction, Take care!\nSincerely ,\nAmber",

I recognized that David loved to look at things closely and observe how things moved, and so I continued to point things out to him as he grew older: planes, cars, shells etc. . David was a keen observer, and I just gave him the suggestions as to where to look.\nToday David is a medical doctor at Columbia University Center.

In his eagerness to draw quick profit from the trees, he has cut them down in large numbers, only to find that without them he has lost the best friends he had.\nTwo thousand years ago a rich and powerful country cut down its trees to build warships, with which to gain itself an empire. It gained the empire but, without its trees, its soil became hard and poor. When the empire fell to pieces, the country found itself faced by floods and starvation.\nEven though a government realizes the importance of a plentiful supply of trees, it is difficult for it to persuade the villager to see this. The villager wants wood to cook his food with, and he can earn money by making charcoal  or selling wood to the townsman . He is usually too lazy or too careless to plant and look after trees. So unless the government has a good system of control, or can educate the people, the forests will slowly disappear.\nThis does not only mean that the villager's sons and grandsons have fewer trees. The results are even more serious. For where there are trees their roots break the soil up--allowing the rain to sink in and also hold the soil, thus preventing it being washed away easily, but where there are no trees, the soil becomes hard and poor. The rain falls on hard ground and flows away on the surface, causing floods and carrying away with it the rich topsoil, in which crops grow so well.

But they are not just for decoration. They are also to stop birds from flying into windows.\nChen Zitong, 14, a Junior 3 student at the school came up with the idea. In early January, she wrote a letter to the headmaster and suggested this. She often saw birds fly into the clean windows and get hurt. After some online research, she found this solution. \"Some people decorated windows with stickers   or posters. Then I thought of replacing   them with our traditional paper cutting art,\" Chen said.\nTo Chen's surprise, the headmaster took her advice. The school organized a paper cutting art competition. Students' works that got awards were pasted on the corridor windows.\nIn fact, there have been paper cutting art classes since 2011. \"We have classes once a week for a month to teach paper cutting,\" said Fan Ming, an art teacher. The teaching building even has a display   wall to show students' works.\nThrough the class, Shi Jiawei, 14, fell in love with the art of paper cutting. \"It's very fun. I can design my own patterns   and present interesting things through it,\" she said. She created many works like bears and magpies  .\nPaper cutting also helps students become more patient. Wang Yiyou, 12, was once an active boy.

The study found that the effects of air pollution were often larger within cities than between cities.\nThe new findings make experts suspect that current pollution limits may be inadequate. Scientists examined rates of heart attack, stroke   and other cardiovascular   events in women with long-term exposure to air pollution.\nThe study involved women over the age of fifty who had no sign of cardiovascular disease at the start of the research. The study followed the women for as long as nine years to see how they would develop cardiovascular problems.\nThe researchers also examined levels of fine particles (,) in the air in 36 areas across the country. That information came from the Environmental Protection Agency. The extremely small particles came from industrial smoke and traffic, along with things like wood-burning fireplaces in houses.\nIn the study, every ten-microgram increase in the risk of a cardiovascular event. But it was related to a seventy-six percent increase in the risk of death from cardiovascular disease.\nBut just how do particles in the air damage the cardiovascular system?

Creativity isn't always connected with great works of art or ideas. People at work and in their free time routinely think of creative ways to solve problems. Maybe you have a goal to achieve,a tricky question to answer or you just want to expand your mind! Here are three techniques to help you.\nThis technique involves taking unrelated ideas and trying to find links between them. First,think about the problem you have to solve or the job you need to do. Then find an image,word,idea or object,for example,a candle. Write down all the ideas/words associated with candles:light,fire,matches, wax,night,silence,etc. Think of as many as you can. The next stage is to relate the ideas to the job you have to do. So imagine you want to buy a friend an original present; you could buy him tickets to a match or take him out for the night.\nImagine that normal limitations don't exist. You have as much time/space/money,etc. as you want. Think about your goal and the new possibilities. If,for example,your goal is to learn to ski, you can now practice skiing every day of your life (because you have the time and the money). Now adapt this to reality. Maybe you can practice skiing every day in December,or every Monday in January.\nLook at the situation from a different point of view. Good negotiators use this technique in business,and so do writers. Fiction writers often imagine they are the characters in their books. They ask questions: what does this character want? Why can't she get it? What changes must she make to get what she wants? What does she dream about? If your goal involves other people, put yourself \"in their shoes\".

With proper planning, though, it is possible to keep normal weight during the holidays. The idea is to enjoy the holidays but not to eat too much. You don't have to turn away from the foods that you enjoy.\nHere are some tips for preventing weight gain and maintaining physical fitness:\nDon't skip meals. Before you leave home, have a small, low-fat meal or snack . This may help to avoid getting too excited before delicious foods.\nControl the amount of food. Use a small plate that may encourage you to \"load up  \". You should be most comfortable eating an amount of food about the size of your fist  .\nBegin with soup and fruit or vegetables. Fill up beforehand on water-based soup and raw fruit or vegetables, or drink a large glass of water before you eat to help you to feel full.\nAvoid high-fat foods. Dishes that look oily or creamy may have large amount of fat. Choose lean meat . Fill your plate with salad and green vegetables. Use lemon juice instead of creamy food.\nStick to physical activity. Don't let exercise take a break during the holidays. A 20-minute walk helps to burn off extra calories.(238 words)",

An early nickname for the policeman was \"peeler\", but this name had died out.\nVisitors to England seem,nearly always, to be very impressed by the English police. In fact, it has become a joke that the visitors to Britain, when asked for his views of the country, will always say,at some point or other, \"I think your policemen are wonderful.\"\nWell, the British bobby may not always be wonderful but he is usually a very friendly and helpful character.\nA music-hall song of some years ago was called, \"If you want to know the time, ask a policeman.\" Nowadays, most people own watches but they still seem to find plenty of other questions to ask the policeman. In London, the policemen spend so much of their time directing visitors about the city that one wonders how they ever find time to do anything else!",

Actually, most people experience nervousness at some time or another.\nIf you are feeling anxious, my advice is to first find the cause or causes. Make a list of those things that are making you nervous and work out which ones you can do something about. Focus all of your efforts on managing the causes that you can control.\nMost people cannot tell the difference between controllable  and uncontrollable causes, so things they can't control become a big reason for nervousness. Dealing with this is very important if people want to keep a healthy mind.\nSimply try to accept the uncontrollable causes of nervousness. You might be worried about the weather on a big day, an accident or an attack on the train, or perhaps just things that other people are doing at work. The results may be very important but there is still no use worrying because you can't control any of these things. Accept that you can't control everything. Once you understand this, it becomes easier not to worry.\nIf a situation, such as swimming, is causing you to be anxious, try to face it as often as possible so that you can get used to it.\nIt can often help to think about yourself doing the thing that makes you nervous--then close your eyes and imagine it going well. Imagine how the flight or job interview is going to happen so that you can get used to it. This will help you understand that the thing you fear most is probably not going to happen.",

That is\nfor life in general.\nSet aside time specifically for each subject. Try to study one subject a day. You need to balance time. If you are bad at balancing things, make a personal timetable. Even if you do not stick to it, you will have an idea what you should be doing each day. This is better than trying to do everything each day and, at the end of the week, not achieve anything. Also, try to keep your weekends free of studying. Only study at the weekend if you really have to.\nI had to learn to balance work, study and family when I was at college. I was a retail assistant working part-time and had at least four modules to complete at the same time at college. I also had to help around the house doing household cleaning and shopping at times. I managed to finish my college work on time, which was very difficult and hard, and still hold down a job.\nWhy was it possible? Because I only thought about my part-time work when I was at work on the weekends and my college work had to be done from Mondays to Fridays before the weekends. This was hard--but you need to set a timetable for yourself. It was an achievement when I finally realized that things have to be done in order, and need to be organized as well.\nBalancing study and other aspects  of your life can be a problem if you have a job or a family, but planning in advance is helpful.

That's happening in one unlikely laboratory: the Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plan in Brooklyn\nThe plant's longtime manager, Jimmy Pynn, shows off the plant's crown jewels: eight huge, shiny, oval-shaped steel tanks known as digester eggs. Each one contains millions of gallons of black material that's roughly pea soup. Pynn calls it \"black gold\". \"The digesters like to be fed like us: three times a day,\" he says. \"They like to be kept warm, 98 degrees. And that's what we have these guys for: to make methane ,which can be used to heat homes or make electricity.\"\nRight now, what these bacteria are digesting is mostly sewage  mud. But they are being introduced to a new diet food scraps. The hope is that this plant will soon take in hundreds of tons of organic waste from houses and apartments.\n\"Cardboard packaging, rotten tomatoes, fats, oils, old diary products--those are all great food-stuff for a digester,\" says Paul Sellew. \"My micro-organisms love that. That's their five-course meal.\"\n\"Everything in New York City is like big scale when you're talking about quantities of waste,\" says Samantha MacBride. \"Right now, it's all in its infancy. When you're in an apartment building, to separate out food scraps, it requires a lot of effort and attention,\" says MacBride. \"It doesn't have to have unpleasant smell or be inconvenient. But it takes extra work. It's the first, what I will call the baby step,\" says Paul Sellew. \"Because ultimately in New York City, just the restaurants alone, you're talking well over a million tons a year,\" he says.\nThis new industry is trying to build more plants and digesters to handle all of that waste, says Sellew. The costliest part may be finding good locations in or around the nation's biggest cities.\nAs for the trillions of bacteria? They'll work for free--- as long as you feed them.",

Don't sweat about one bad grade, but always strive to do your best.\n2. Get involved, and stay involved, in extracurricular activities. Sports, clubs, drama, bands and orchestras-these often count toward a student's overall scholarship application evaluation. The same goes for paid (or unpaid) work experience.\n3. Begin your scholarship research early-by your sophomore or junior year of high school, if possible. Make special note of application deadlines, as they can vary from late summer to late spring.\n4. Apply for as many scholarships as you are eligible for-several smaller scholarships can add up to a lot of money.\n*During the application process\n1. Read the supplementary materials that come with scholarship application forms to better understand the program's focus (community service, subject interest). Try to answer the questions with the focus area in mind.\n2. Answer questions as they are asked. Don't go off the topic.\n3. If there is a financial component to the application, make sure you get accurate and complete information from all appropriate sources to ensure your eligibility.\n4. Take your time. Write down everything you can think of for each question, then set the application aside for a day so you can look everything over again before you send it off.\n5. Don't wait until the last minute to complete your application, especially if you are applying online. Computer systems can get clogged with the large volume of applicants hoping to submit their qualifications during the last few days and hours before a deadline.\n6. If a third party has to complete part of your application, such as providing a letter of recommendation, make sure you ask them early on and remind them as often as necessary to ensure they provide you with the necessary materials.\n7. Last but not least, review your application with your parents to make sure you haven't left out any important details.\nGood luck to the students applying for the 2014 scholarship programs!",

But in trying to hold back the images, she caused a different result. Her legal actions led to almost half a million people visiting the website, viewing and copying the photos within a month.\nEver since then, the effect of letting public know something you are trying to keep secret has been called the \"Streisand effect\". The problem for anyone trying to cover up information is that the Internet is the world's biggest and most useful copying machine. Put a document   on to a connected machine and it will spread. So when you want to be famous, you can't, but if you find yourself receiving too much attention and want to remove yourself, you cannot.  \nThere are many examples of the Streisand effect. Nine-year-old Martha Payne created a simple blog, posting the meals her school served. She took a photo of what was hardly a satisfying meal by anyone's standards. With the photo, she added a comment, \"Now Dad understands why I am hungry when I get home.\" The thing did not go too far, until the local authority   banned   little Martha from doing that again. Martha posted a final post called \"Goodbye\", explaining everything. Once the media found this out, things went from bad to worse for the authority. Now the blog has more than 9.5 million page views. Martha has even expanded her blog by including pictures of school meals taken by other kids from all over the world, like Germany and Japan.\nWe can find similar examples throughout history. Man has experienced the Streisand effect ever since the birth of mass communication. Why does it exist? Every time you are told not to see what's in the secret shiny box wrapped in gift paper, you're going to do everything in your power to do exactly that! Just realizing that knowing something about someone is harmful to their status, we will want to know that piece of information. This is exactly the human nature. This is what lawyers and authorities should be familiar with. Unfortunately, a few of them fail to understand it.",

        "passage": "When you read an article you will understand and remember it better if you can work out how the writer has put the ideas together.Sometimes a writer puts ideas together by asking questions and then answering them.For example,if the article is about groundhogs ,the set of questions in the writer's head might be:\nWhat does a groundhog look like?\nWhere do groundhogs live?\nWhat do they eat?...\nIn the article,the author might answer those questions.\nSometimes an author writes out her questions in the article.These questions give you signals.They tell you what the author is going to write next.Often an author has a question in her head but she doesn't write it out for you.You have to work out her question for yourself.Here's a sample reading for you to practice this method.\nEarthworms\nDo you know how many kinds of earthworms there are?There are about 1800 kinds in the world! They can be brown,purple,green.They can be as small as 3 cm long and as large as 3 m long.\nThe best time to see earthworms is at night,especially a cool,damp night.That's when they come up from their burrows to hunt for food.Earthworms don't like to be in the sun.That's because they breathe through their skin,and they can't breathe if their skin gets too dry.Earthworms must come out of the earth if it rains a lot,because they can't breathe in their flooded burrows.What a dangerous life!\nEarthworms don't have eyes,so how can they tell when it's dark? They have special places on their skin that are sensitive to light.These spots tell whether it's light or dark.If you shine a flashlight on an earthworm at night,it will quickly disappear into the ground.\nEarthworms don't have ears either,but they can hear by feeling movements in the earth.If you want to hear like an earthworm,lie on the ground with your fingers in your ears.Then have a friend stamp his or her feet near you.This is how earthworms feel birds and people walking,and moles digging,near them.\nEarthworms are useful.Farmers and gardeners like having lots of earthworms in their land because the worms help to make better soil when they dig.That digging keeps the soil loose and airy .In one year earthworms can pile up as much as 23,000 kg of castings in an area about the size of a football field.",

        "passage": "The word I'm going to introduce to you today is-phubbing. Let's see the definition of this term:phubbing n. the act of snubbing someone in a social setting by looking at your cell phone instead of paying attention As you can probably guess, phubbing is a blend of phone and snubbing. The term was coined by a 23-year-old Melbourne resident Alex Haigh. Obviously, he got fed up with how people are always checking Facebook or Twitter on their phones when they are supposed to be interacting with someone face to face. He wanted to put an end to this social phenomenon, therefore he came up with this catchy term.\nAnd it did catch on. The word's earliest media mention dates back to June 2012, and in a little over a year's time, phubbing has already been picked up by almost all the mainstream media outlets one can think of.\nHere is a typical example from the British newspaper The Independent. In the article titled The Rise of Phubbing, which was published on August 5, 2013, Tom Chatfield writes, there's an uncomfortable truth at the heart of phubbing: other people are easier to handle when seen on screen. They're less likely to demand unreasonable efforts such as undivided attention or clean shirts.\nWhile the term phubbing has undoubtedly taken off, some people question why it is called phubbing instead of phnubbing. Alex Haigh has not personally addressed the issue, but word has it that phubbing sounds more crispy and thus easier to remember.\nPhubbing is indeed a univers al problem that can no longer be ignored. So why do people keep phubbing each other if they know it's rude? Is there anything we can do to stop it? Or maybe we should just be more kind, because sometimes there are good excuses to phub.\nI think there is plenty we can do to try and stop phubbing. For starters, we can jo in Alex Haigh in his Stop Phubbing campaign. Remind our friends and family that phubbing is not appreciated. We can also make or download some anti-phubbing posters to spread the word in public places. And don't forget that some phubbers simply do not realize the harmful effect their behavior has on others,so be b rave enough to stop them, even if you are a total stranger.",

        "passage": "People with disabilities make up a large part of the population. It is estimated  that over 35 million Americans have physical, mental, or other disabilities. About half of these disabilities are \"developmental\", i.e., they occur before the individual's twenty-second birthday, often from genetic conditions, and are severe enough to affect three or more areas of development, such as mobility, communication, employment, etc. Most other disabilities are considered \"adventitious\", i.e., accidental or caused by outside forces.\nPrior to the 20th century, only a small percentage of people with disabilities survived for long. Medical treatment for these disabilities was unavailable. Advancements in medicine and social services have created a climate in which people with disabilities can expect to have such basic needs as food, shelter, and medical treatment. Unfortunately, these basics are often not available. Civil liberties such as the right to vote, marry, get an education, and gain employment have historically been denied on the basis of disability.\nIn recent decades, the disability rights movement has been organized to fight against these infringements(;)of civil rights. Congress responded by passing major legislation recognizing people with disabilities as a protected class under civil rights statutes.\nStill today, people with disabilities must fight to live their lives independently. It is estimated that more than half of qualified Americans with disabilities are unemployed, and a majority of those who do work are underemployed. About two-thirds live at or below the official poverty level.\nSignificant barriers, especially in transportation and public awareness, prevent disabled people from taking part in society. For example, while no longer prohibited by law from marrying, a person with no access to transportation is effectively excluded from community and social activities which might lead to the development of long-term relationships.\nOnly when public attitudes advance as far as laws have will disabled people be fully able to take their rightful place in society.",

I wanted to be an actor or work in the entertainment industry...living a creative life. My choice of civil engineering was really a mistake but I realized too late. As soon as I graduated, I moved straight to Los Angeles--the home of the film and television industry!\nFor three years, I tried to get a job in that field. I often worked as an extra in movies and TV shows--standing in the background while actors are in the foreground. This was fun for a while, but I wanted a real acting job, where I was speaking!

Being an extra couldn't make enough money for me to live in Los Angeles. I had to do something else for money.\nAfter three years of trying, I gave up my dream of being an actor and started a different career. I then tried network-marketing, but in the end, that failed. Seven years after graduating college, I was still in debt, still searching for a satisfactory life.

So, you can imagine that I was unprepared for the outpouring of public grief  at a Chinese funeral.\nMy editorial team leader died recently after a short illness. He was 31. The news was so unexpected that it left us all shocked and upset. A female colleague burst into tears and cried piteously at her desk. Somehow we got through the day's work. The next day was the funeral.\nOur big boss stepped forward to deliver a eulogy and was soon in tears. She carried on, in Chinese of course, but at the end said in English: \"There will be no more deadlines for you in heaven.\" Next came a long-term colleague who also dissolved in tears but carried on with her speech despite being almost overcome by emotion. Then a close friend of the dead man paid tribute , weeping openly as he spoke. Sorrow is spreading. Me and women were now sobbing uncontrollably. Finally, the man's mother, supported between two women, addressed her son in his coffin. At one point, the mother almost collapsed and had to be held up. We were invited to step forward to each lay a white rose on the casket. Our dead colleague looked as if he was taking a nap. At the end of the service I walked away from the funeral parlor stunned at the outpouring of emotion.\nIn the UK, families grieve privately and then try to hold it together and not break down at a funeral. Here in China it would seem that grieving is a public affair. It strikes me that it is more cathartic to cry your eyes out than try to keep it bottled up for fear of embarrassment, which is what many of us do in the West.\nAfterwards, a Chinese colleague told me that the lamenting at the funeral had been restrained  by Chinese standards. In some rural areas, she said, people used to be paid to mourn noisily. This struck me like something out of novel by Charles Dickens. But we have all seen on TV scenes of grief-stricken people in Gaza and the West Bank, in Afghanistan, Iraq and the relatives of victims of terrorist bombings around the world. Chinese grief is no different. I realized that it's the reserved British way of mourning that is out of step with the rest of the world.\nIt was our newspaper's production day. We were bussed back to the office to resume work. No more deadlines for our former colleague, but we had to pull together to put the newspaper to print. The boss invited the team to go out for dinner after work. We relaxed, smiled, joked. There was no mention of the funeral or our poor colleague. Enough sorrow had been shed already.

Dogs and cats have been popular Christmas gifts in the gifts in the UK and Europe for many years. But some people still haven't quite got the message.\nThe slogan still holds good. Some 105,000 dogs were _ by local government last year because they had been abandoned, many of them shortly after the festival season.\nThe main reason given by owners for handing their dogs over to the Dogs Trust is that the dogs need more attention than they can give; behavioral problems and moving home are also reasons given.\nBut Eleanor Silk, the Trust's communications director, says, \"It's often four or five months after Christmas, in early summer, when owners find that the dog has got too big and too active, or it hasn't been trained properly and has caused damage around the home.\"\nIn any case, some organizations that help pets are quick to point out that if you are serious about getting a puppy  as a pet, Christmas is not the time to do it. Puppies need to get used to their new surroundings, to be introduced to a routine, and to be looked after like small children. It's hard to meet any of these needs at Christmas. What's more, pulling a puppy out of a Christmas stocking in itself sends the wrong message to children. It encourages children to think of the puppy as a toy, rather than a responsibility.\nAppreciating what you're taking on with a dog can be a sobering   realization. \"For life\" means thinking about the effect they'll have on your life. It also infers you will need to care for the dog for its whole life.",

In fact I know of some home-based entrepreneurs who would rather meet their clients in a neutral ground, e.g. the client's office or even Starbucks.\n    There are other ways to keep burglars away from your house.\n    *Keep lights on around your house in the evenings. Light is a natural fright for burglars.\n*Invest in a security alarm, particularly if your house is located in a remote spot. Security systems can often bring down the cost of your homeowner's insurance premiums .\n*Make sure that all windows and doors are locked and the security alarm turned on before you sleep at night or go out of the house. Avoid keeping house keys in obvious places, such as under the lamp or top of the doorframe.\n*Adding an additional lock will provide extra security when you are home. The dead-lock, sometimes called an \"exit-only deadbolt\" is an deadbolt that doesn't have an external key. It's clearly visible on the door from the outside, but can't be broken into without destroying the door, frame, or lock itself. While the security won't help directly when you aren't home, the visibility may discourage an  _ from trying the door.\n*Your door itself should be made of strong materials, such as one-inch thick solid hardwood or heavy metal.",

A recently published study also appears to demonstrate that the good effects of training can last for many years after that training has ended.\nResearchers at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland wanted to learn how long memory and thinking skills would last in older people who trained to keep them. The people were part of the ten-year research project. They were taught methods meant to improve their memory, thinking and ability to perform everyday tasks.\nMore than 2,800 volunteered for the study called ACTIVE - short for Advanced (Cognitive) Training for Independent and Vital Elderly. Most studied when they were more than 70 years old.\nThe volunteers took one of several short training classes meant to help them keep their mental abilities. One class trained participants in skills including how to remember word lists. Another group trained in reasoning. A third group received help with speed-of-processing - speed of receiving and understanding information. A fourth group - the control group did not get any training.\nEarlier results had established that the training helped the participants for up to five years. Now, lead study writer George Rebok says, the research showed most of the training remained effective a full ten years later.\nProfessor Rebok and his team found that the people trained in reasoning and speed-of-processing did better on tests than the control group.\n\"We are wondering whether those effects which endured over time would still be there ten years following the training, and in fact, that's exactly what we found.\"\nThe effect on memory, however, seemed not to last as long. Still, the old people in any of the three classes generally reported less difficulty in performing daily activities than the control group.

Some even win local talent competitions as children, but only a few such early successes and dreams turn into reality. Jessica Andrews is one of the few whose dreams have come true.\nAndrews, first taste of success came at the age of 10. She won a talent competition in her home town of Huntingdon, Tennessee, singing I Will Always Love You, originally sung by Whitney Houston. Houston's version of the song appeared on The Bodyguard sound track, which happened to be the first album Andrews ever bought.\nWithin two years, talk of Andrews had spread to Nashville and caught the attention of producer Byron Gallimore, whose credits include work with Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, and Jo Dee Messina. With Gallimore signed on to produce, Andrews soon had a recording contract  with Dream Works' Nashville label.\nAndrews' professional career was launched with 1999's Heart Shaped World, recorded when she was 14 years old. The album included the country hit I Will Be There For You, which also appeared on The Prince Of Egypt . She followed up the release of the album by touring as a support act for such country superstars as Faith Hill and Trisha Yearwood.\nWith the release of 2001's, Who I Am, Andrews became a star in her own right. The album was certified  gold for sales of 500,000 copies. Andrews returned in April 2003 with Now,an album that she promised would show a new side of the young artist. \"This album has a very different feeling for me,\" she said. \"It's a lot more personal and there's a confidence that wasn't quite there on the first two.

I do not mean that I was hurt: no one was hurt.\nI do my work in a hot country far away from England. Every September I go there to do my business, and every July I come back to England to have a rest. So every September I go to Paris and take a train from the great French city to Mendova, and at Mendova I catch my ship.\nThere is one very fast train from Paris to Mendova, and it suits me well. It goes as far as Endoran, but it stops at Mendova for a few minutes to let travelers get out or in. It is called The Flying Bluebird. It reaches Mendova at seven minutes past nine in the morning, and it is never late.\nA ship leaves Mendova at half past eleven, and so you will understand that The Flying Bluebird suits me very well. I always travel by it, and I have nearly two and a half hours at Mendova to go from the station to the ship. That is more than enough time.\nWell, one September night, I took my place in The Flying Bluebird as usual. The train leaves Paris at nine o'clock every night, and I was in my place soon after half past eight. There were three or four people there with me, but very soon a lot of others got into the train. When no more people could sit down, they began to stand up near us and also in the corridor . In a short time the corridor was full too, and it was impossible for any more travelers to get into the train.\nI could see a lot of other people outside the corridor windows, but they could not get in, and the train left Paris without them. The man sitting next to me started to ask all kinds of questions: \"Where do you work? How long does it take you to get there? Are you married? How many children do you have? How much money do they pay you every year? How much do you have in the bank? How much do you spend every month?\"\nHe asked questions for about twenty minutes but I did not give him any clear answers, and at last he stopped and began to read the paper.\nI usually sleep quite well in the train, but this time I slept only a little. There were too many people, and there were too many things: small bags, large bags, coats, hats, boxes, newspapers and food. As usual, we got angry about the window. Most people wanted it shut, and two of us wanted it open. But that always happens. It was shut all night, as usual.\nWhen I awoke in the early morning I felt hot and dirty, and glad that the journey was reaching its end. At seven minutes past nine The Flying Bluebird stopped. We were at Mendova, and I stood up thankfully. I took my two suitcases, held one in each hand, and tried to move towards the door into the corridor. In order to get out of the train, I had to pass down the corridor to the door at the far end. There was no other way out.\nI could not even into the corridor. There was a suitcase on the floor by my feet, and three men were standing in my way. I felt a touch of fear. I had to get out, you see; I had to catch my ship, which left at half past eleven. And the train did not stop again until it reached Endoran, two hundred miles away.\n\"I must get out!\" I cried. Everyone there understood me, but no one could move.\nAt last I was able to put one foot over the suitcase on the floor, and I nearly reached the door into the corridor. But then, very slowly, the train began to move. It was taking me away!\n\"Stop!\" I cried. \"I want to get out!\" But no one outside the train could hear me, and the people inside did not care much. The train moved a little faster. What could I do? I was not even in the corridor.\nFear made me think quickly. In front of my eyes, just, above the door, was a notice that told everyone how to stop the train. I had to pull an iron thing near the notice. I did not waste time. I pulled it.\nWell, _ That was to show everyone that there was something wrong. It was not a small sound. Possibly the men in my ship two miles away could hear it. Then the train stopped.\nNo one likes to stop a train if there is no need. But I had to catch my ship. That was the only thought in my mind: to get out and catch my ship.",

Soon after that, Forbes moved to London. He took four different jobs at three companies over the next five years. Forbes wanted a better job and higher pay---he was never quite satisfied.\nWelcome to the world of a job hopper. Forbes's story isn't unusual these days and such frequent movement from one job to the next will become more common. The main reason: the nature of employment is changing. There are a lot more contracts and part-time jobs or flexible employment. That leads to people having a greater number of jobs. What's more, layoffs  and pay freezes , among other things, have pushed people from one job to another. In some cases, a bad worldwide job market has limited opportunities for star employees, promoting them to seek new challenges at other companies.\nHowever, employers often think that if a person jumped from his last employer after a short period, he will likely do the same again --- there is a significant financial risk in hiring someone who leaves in short order.\nWhat's more, moving from company to company frequently doesn't mean workers are climbing the corporate ladder  faster. In 2005, Monika Hamori, a professor at Spain's IE Business School, looked at CEOs at about 55 to see if those who moved around more frequently climbed the ladder faster.\nShe found that executives who stayed with one company became CEOs after 23 years, while executives who changed companies many times became CEOs after 26 years. One reason: workers within the same organization tend to be promoted more frequently and be offered better jobs.",

They find the writing process painful and difficult.\nHow awful it is to be able to speak in a language but not to write in it, especially with its rich vocabulary. Being able to speak but not write is like living in _ and never leaving one small room. When I meet students who think they can't write, I know, as a teacher my duty is to show them the rest of the rooms. My task is to build fluency and accuracy while providing the opportunity in any writing activity to enhance the moral and emotional development of my students.\nOne great way to do this is by having students write in a journal in class every day.\nWriting ability is like strength training. Writing needs to be done just like exercise; just as muscles grow stronger with exercise, writing skills improve quickly with writing practice daily. I often see a rise in student confidence and performance after only a few weeks of journal writing.\nExpressing oneself in writing is one of the most important skills I teach to strengthen the whole students. When my students practice journal writing, they are practicing for their future academic, political, and emotional lives. They build skills so that some say they might write a great novel, a piece of sorely needed legislation , or the perfect love letter. That they write in their journals every day puts them a step closer to fluency, eloquence and command of the language.",

Ask them where they're from, why they come to China, etc. . Remember: Be careful not to ask personal questions about age, salary and so on.\n4. Show an interest in their culture, their country or their job. Americans like to talk about themselves!\n5. Invite them to join you for dinner or just for coffee or tea. Try to set a specific time. Americans sometimes make general invitations like \"Let's go out for dinner sometime. \"Often this is just a way to be friendly. It is not always a real invitation.\n6.

He put clues in the story to help readers find it. Thousands of people hunted for the treasure. They dug holes all over Britain, hoping to find it.\nOne of the most popular adventure stories ever written is Robert Louis Stephenson's \"Treasured Island\", an exciting story about a young boy, Jim Hawkins, who is captured by pirates   and later finds some buried treasure.\nThen there is the true story about a man who had to travel overseas for a year. He did not trust banks, so he buried his life savings in a park. Then he went away. On his return, he went straight to the park. But the park was no longer there. In its place there was a huge building.\nAnd then there was the man who buried his savings, all in bank notes, in a waterproof bag. When he dug it up years later, there was nothing left. Worms and insects had eaten the bag and everything in it.\nAnd of course, these are stories about people who bury things and either forget where they have buried them or lose the map.\nAlthough it is true that people sometimes lose their money because a bank fails, banks are still the safest place to keep our savings and treasures.",

Although Denmark has been protected from economic problems thanks to its low public debt, qualified   professionals are still finding it tough to get a job. Danish marketing firm Reputation Copenhagen has come up with a way of helping academics get noticed -- putting them on display   in storefront windows.\nMany highly-trained professionals, ranging from former CEOs to lawyers and tax experts, are currently finding it increasingly difficult to find proper employment on the Danish job market. Some of them have been trying for years, leaving their resumes   with dozens of companies, without ever hearing back from them, and are now at a point where they are willing to try anything, even putting themselves in display windows like goods, hoping to get noticed.\nAlexander Peitersen, managing director of Reputation Copenhagen, came up with the idea of using his company's office as a storefront for the campaign  , as there are many businesses nearby that might be interested in the talents on display. So he set up a small desk, put up the \"an available academic is sitting here\" sign and asked the unemployed to just sit in the windows like goods. It seems like a pretty desperate measure, but at least it works. According to the agency's website, three of the jobseekers in their window display got a job in a day or two.\nPeitersen says he came up with the idea after realizing human resource managers get hundreds of job applications every day, which look more or less the same, and that creative thinking is required in order to increase the chances of finding employment. Apart from companies interested in qualified job-seekers, the campaign has also attracted the attention of both local and international media.",

        "passage": "Throughout the world, clothing has many uses. It is used to provide protection from cold. It is also worn to prevent others from seeing specific parts of one's body. However, the parts of the body that must be covered vary widely throughout the world. Some clothing is worn to provide supernatural protection. Wearing a lucky shirt to take an exam is calling for supernatural assistance.\nPeople in all cultures use clothing and other forms of bodily decoration to communicate status , intentions and other messages. In North America, we dress differently for business and various leisure activities. North American women usually are much more knowledgeable of little difference in messages communicated by clothes than men. At times, this leads to silly mistakes of understanding of female intentions on the part of men. Of course, clothing styles also are intended to communicate messages to members of the same gender .\nLong before we are near enough to talk to someone, their appearance tells their gender, age, economic class, and often even intentions. We begin to recognize the important cultural clues at an early age. The vocabulary of dress that we learn includes not only items of clothing but also hairstyles, jewelry, and other body decoration. In most cultures, however, the same style of dress communicates different messages depending on the age, gender, and physical appearance of the individual wearing it.\nPutting on certain types of clothing can change your behavior and the behavior of others towards you. This can be the case with a doctor's white lab coat, or an army uniform. Most uniforms are clearly symbolic so that they can rapidly and unmistakably communicate status. For instance, the strange hairstyle and clothing of the English \"punks\" are essential aspects of their uniforms.\nThere are many forms of body decoration other than clothes that are used around the world to send messages. These include body and hair paint, and even body deformation. When doctors put braces on teeth, they are actually doing the same thing - deforming or reforming a part of the body to make it more attractive.",

Later, all citizens were allowed to vote. Thus the town meeting became truly democratic. Town meetings are still common in New England communities.\nIn recent years the town meeting idea has been widely imitated. There are open sessions of this kind on radio and television.

You may believe that every other type of pollution has a larger impact on the environment than light pollution does. But light pollution is serious.\nLight pollution, or \"sky glow\", is the glow  you can see at night above cities and towns. Light pollution is a problem that has been accompanying man ever since he started his first fire some 15,000 years ago. Light pollution is the light  that comes from streetlights, buildings, parking lots and any other source of light that is reflected or directed into the atmosphere.\nUrban light pollution means that one-fifth of the world's population can no longer see the Milky Way  with the naked eye . Many city kids, even if they did look through the orange smog above their heads, would probably see only a handful of stars. We have lost our view of the stars, and we have _ our  night-time environment as well. Astronomers are calling for the dark places on Earth to be preserved as national parks.\nLots of people find the ever-brightening night annoying, and animals that are programmed to prefer the dark may avoid a brightened habitat. Sea turtles can get lost searching for a beach to lay eggs, and their hatchlings may confuse over-lit beachfront resorts  for the ocean horizon, wasting precious energy needed to find the sea and escape predators . Because their necks aren't yet long enough to see things far away, baby turtles rely on the mirror image of the moon to guide them to the sea, to begin their new life. A car may even hit a particular turtle, which was thinking the light from a nearby city was moonlight reflecting off the ocean waves. Birds that live in and around cities can die because of sky glow, too. The bright lights can blind them, leading to countless collisions with buildings and other tall structures.\nReducing light pollution is not difficult.Light pollution is the easiest type of pollution to end. people can help reduce much sky glow by using lighting only when necessary. The stars above us are priceless heritage-- for not only for astronomers but for all humans. More of our children should be able to look up at night and see the Milk Way is not just a candy bar.",

He was also very angry.\nPaul Newman's camp counselors ( ) were hoping to fill David's days with fun and laughter. But David stayed inside himself, wanting to be alone, or in a corner of the cabin. At this camp for children with life-threatening illnesses, we had seen some pretty tough children worn out by cancer recover full of energy despite their illness. But we saw little progress in David no matter what we tried with him. Five days into the eight-day session saw a quiet, sad little pirate.\n Then something happened on that fifth night. Something at camp that we would call \"huge\". \nIt was cabin night. That's the time when campers and counselors spend lime together in each individual cabin instead of an all-camp activity. Campers love cabin nights because there's always a bedtime snack. On the cabin table that night were bags of potato chips.\nDavid slowly walked over to the table, leaving his comer to join the rest of us. He took one of the bags of the potato chips and started smashing  it with his little fists, as all the other campers looked on in disbelief, I wondered what the cabin counselor would do.\nThe college-age volunteer counselor positioned a bag of chips on die table in front of himself, and he, too, started smashing it with his fist. The campers went crazy as everyone ran to the table to get in on the fun of smashing potato chips with their fists.\nSomehow everyone knew, everyone sensed, that anger within him was now being released. \nFor the last couple days of the session, David was a different kid. He was a little nine-year-old boy again, trying to fill the hours of each remaining day at camp with as much fun as could be possible.\nSeveral days after the session, David came back again. This time, there wasn't anything he wouldn't try to fit in to his day. He sure was having a great time at camp. David asked me if I needed an altar boy when I celebrated Mass in the woods. Sure enough, he was my altar boy. I remembered how carefully he listened to me when I talked about death. 1 said it's only a doorway. You walk through the door and there's the Lord God and behind God a whole line of people waiting to hug you.\nAfter Mass, he said to me, \"Hey Fatha, a door, huh?\"\nA couple more days of fun passed and tonight was the talent show. The tradition is that campers and counselors dress up in costumes, and everyone gets a standing applause for singing and dancing or simply just acting like fools on stage.\n The show had begun: lights, camera, action.\nUnfortunately, the only action taking place in our row of seats was little David making his way from counselor to counselor to say an early good-bye to camp. He had become quite ill and had to go to the hospital because of this new crisis.\nWhen this little nine-year-old pirate stood in front of me, he gave me a hug and a big wet kiss on my cheek. 1 was crying. He was crying. A whole row of counselors was in tears. After the hug and kiss, he put his hands on my shoulders, and tears still in his eyes, said: \"See you on the other side of the door, Fatha.\"",

It is a good exercise, yet many people find it boring. But what if making your morning jog a creative one?Like jumping from walls and over gaps and ground rolls? Just like the James Bond in the movie Casino Royale? Bond jumps down from a roof to a windowsill and then runs several blocks over _ on the way. It is just because of Bond's wonderful performances that the sport has become popular worldwide.\nYes, that's parkour, an extreme street sport aimed at moving from one point to another as quickly as possible, getting over all the obstacles in the path using only the abilities of the human body. Parkour is considered an extreme sport. As its participants dash around a city, they may jump over fences, run up walls and even move from rooftop to rooftop.\nParkour can be just as exciting and charming as it sounds,but its participants see parkour much more than that.\nOvercoming all the obstacles on the course and in life is part of the philosophy   behind parkour. This is the same as life. You must determine your destination, go straight, and jump over all the barriers as if in parkour and never fall back from them in your life, to reach the destination successfully. A parkour lover said,\"I love parkour because its philosophy has become my life, my way to do everything.\"\nAnother philosophy we've learnt from parkour is freedom. It can be done by anyone, at any time, anywhere in the world. It is a kind of expression of trust in yourself that you earn energy and confidence.",

Fred, nineteen, spent last year in Germany with George's family. In turn, George's son Mike spent a year in Fred's home in America.\nFred knew little German when he arrived, but after two months' study, the language began to come to him. School was completely different from what he had expected --- much harder. Students rose respectfully when a teacher entered the room. They took fourteen subjects instead of the six that are usual in the United States. There were almost no extracurricular  activities.\nFamily life, too, was different. The father's word was law, and all activities were around the family rather than the individual . Fred found the food too simple at first. Also, he missed having a car.\n'Back home, you pick up some friends in a car and go out and have a good time. In Germany, you walk, but you soon learn to like it.'\nAt the same time, in America, Mike, a friendly German boy, was also forming his idea. 'I suppose I should criticize American schools,' he said.

Organizers said the voyage was made to protect Taiwanese fishing rights in nearby waters and to protest Japan's \"purchase\" of part of the Diaoyu Islands.\nThe Japanese government announced a plan to \"purchase\" part of the islands earlier this month despite repeated protests from the Chinese government.

        "passage": "Scientists have exactly discovered the set of brain cells involved in making risky decisions, and have been able to control them in rats using targeted light. By changing the activity of the cells they were able to change the behaviour of risk-taking rats to avoid risk, hinting the approach could in future be used to treat people with impulse   control problems.\nRisk-taking is a key part of survival, knowing when to take a chance could pay off--such as moving to a new area to look for food when pickings are slim.\nWhile all animals need an element of risk, the preference towards it varies between individuals. Researchers found this variation, which determines how risk-averse an individual is, is regulated by brain cells in a region of the brain called the nucleus accumbens. This cluster of neurons releases the neurotransmitter dopamine, which regulates the brain's reward and pleasure centres.\nPrevious studies have shown that in patients with Parkinson's disease, taking medication which blocks specific dopamine receptors (DR2)   leads to increased gambling   behaviour and risk taking behaviour. In studies with rats, researchers were able to use a technique called optogenetics  --which uses light sensitive proteins to change the activity of cells--to modify cells with DR2 in the nucleus accumbens.\nRats were trained to choose one of two levers, offering them a choice between a \"safe\" or \"risky\" choice. The safe option resulted in a small, but consistent amount of a sugar water treat. But the risky choice consistently delivered smaller amounts of sugar water, with the occasional large pay off--essentially encouraging the animals to gamble for a bigger prize. Around two-thirds of the animals weren't keen on risk, opting for the safe option, but the remaining third were risk-seekers. Brain scans of the animals showed that those with low levels of DR2 consistently went for the gamble.\nBut using pulses of light to stimulate   the DR2 cells and improve their activity could cause the risk-takers to play it safe and opt for the guaranteed but less rewarding option. Once the light-pulses stopped, the risk-takers returned to their gambling strategy.\nIn the _ , stimulating the same cells had little to no effect.\nProfessor Karl Deisseroth, of Stanford University in California, said: \"Humans and rats have similar brain structures involved.\"And we found a drug known to increase risk preference in people had the same effect on the rats. So every indication is that these findings are relevant to humans. \"Risky behavior has its moments where it' s valuable. As a species, we wouldn't have come as far as we have without it.\"",

Actually, it may be confirmed as a very crowded place by new computer models developed to help identify habitable planets.\nEstimates of places where life can exist have been based on the possibility of them having surface water. But software recently developed by the Aberdeen University allows researchers to identify planets with underground water kept liquid by heat from planets.\nWater is fundamental for life and planets too close to the sun lose water to the atmosphere through evaporation. On the other hand, planets located in distant reaches from their star have their surface water locked away as ice.\nSean McMahon, who is carrying out the work, explained: \"Traditionally people have said that if a planet is in this Goldilocks zone--not too hot and not too cold--then it can have liquid water on its surface and be habitable.\"\nBut this concept might change when considering that planets can receive two sources of heat--heat direct from the star and heat generated deep inside the planet.\nIt is easy to observe it in our own planet. As you go down through the crust   of the Earth, the temperature gets higher and higher. Even when the surface is frozen, water can exist below ground.\nThere could be immense quantities of water in fact--full of primitive life.\nProfessor John Parnell, also from Aberdeen University said: \"There is a significant habitat for microorganisms below the surface of the Earth, extending down several kilometres\".\n\"And some believe that the majority of life on Earth could even reside in this deep biosphere.\"\nSo the Aberdeen team are developing models to predict which distant planets might harbour underground reservoirs of liquid water with the possibility of alien life.",

        "passage": "The dirt road made our car jump as we traveled to the Millennium Village in Sauri, Kenya. We passed the market where women sat on the dusty ground selling bananas. Little kids were wrapped in cloth on their mothers' backs, or running around in bare feet and torn clothing. When we reached the village, we walked to the Bar Sauri Primary School to meet the people. Welcoming music and singing had almost everyone dancing. We joined the dancing and clapped along to the joyful, lively music. The year was 2004, the first time I had ever been to Sauri.\nThe Millennium Village project was created to help reach the Millennium Development Goals, which were set by the United Nations in 2000. The plan is to get people out of poverty, assure them of access to health care and help them stabilize the economy and quality of life in their communities. The goals are supposed to be met by 2015; some other targets are set for 2025. But our first sight of Sauri showed us there was plenty of work to do.\nOn that day in 2004, we followed the village leaders into Yala Sub-District Hospital. It wasn't in good shape. The rooms were packed with patients who probably wouldn't receive treatment, either because the hospital did not have it or the patients could not afford it. There was no running water or electricity in the hospital. It is hard for me to see people sick with preventable diseases who are near death when they shouldn't have to be. I just get scared and sad.\nMalaria is one disease, common in Africa, which is preventable and treatable. Mosquitoes carry malaria, and infect people by biting them. Kids can die from it easily, and adults get very sick. Mosquitoes that carry malaria come at night. A mosquito net, treated with chemicals that last for five years, keeps malarial mosquitoes away from sleeping people. Each net costs $5. There are some cheap medicines to get rid of malaria too. The solutions are simple, yet 20,000 kids die from the disease each day. So sad, and so illogical. Mosquito nets could save millions of lives.\nWe walked over to see the farmers. Their crops started to die because they could not afford the necessary fertilizer and irrigation. Time and again, a family will plant seeds only to have an outcome of poor crops because of lack of fertilizer and water. Each year, the farmers worry: Will they harvest enough food to feed the whole family? Will their kids go hungry and become sick?\nMany kids in Sauri didn't attend school because their parents couldn't afford school fees. Some kids are needed to help with housework, such as fetching water and wood. In 2004, the schools had _ supplies like books paper and pencils, but the students wanted to learn. They all worked hard with the few supplies they had. It was hard for them to concentrate, though, as there's no midday meal.\nGreat changes have taken place in these years. Today, Yala Sub-District Hospital has medicine, free of charge. Water is connected to the hospital, which also has a generator for electricity. There are no school fees, and the school now serves midday meals for the students. The attendance rate is way up. All this is encouraging supporters of the Millennium Villages project.\nThere are many solutions to the problems that keep people poor. What it will really take is for the world to work together to change poor areas forever. When my kids are my age, I want this kind of poverty to be a thing of history. It will not be an easy task. But Sauri's progress shows us all that winning the fight against poverty is achievable in our lifetime.",

        "passage": "Iceland, an island just south of the Arctic Circle, has fairly mild winters,  thanks to warm ocean currents. Time your vacation here during the winter months to take advantage of off-season deals.\nOff-season means good deals on flights, hotels and tours. You may also find that the locals are a bit friendlier and more welcoming when tourists aren't arriving in crowds.\nIn the winter months, there are less than seven hours of daylight; thus, chances are good you'll catch sight of the northern lights. Sunsets are also beautiful at this time, making for some great photo opportunities.\nIn Iceland, winter is the perfect time to hike glaciers, go ice climbing, explore caves made out of hardened lava  and much more. One of the most popular activities is off-roading  in a specially-equipped \"super jeep\".\nBefore booking your trip, be sure to check for volcano alerts. There are about 130 volcanoes on or around Iceland. Thirty-five of them are active. In 2010, a volcano named Eyjaallajokull exploded, sending clouds of ash up to four kilometers into the atmosphere. The ash drifted toward the UK and Europe. Because the ask could damage aircraft engines, airlines operating in the region were forced to cancel flights for six days. As a result, thousands of people were stuck in airports.\nRecently, another volcano named Bardarbunga has become active, erupting ash into the air. Such events, if large enough, could prevent your trip from going ahead. So check the latest volcano news prior to making your reservations.",

He ended up in the safer neighborhood of Coventry where there was a safer park with fewer dangers. \n\"All of these life lessons have shaped me into who I am, transforming my dreams and aspirations and allowing me to free myself from what was becoming an unproductive environment,\" he wrote in his blog post.\nDavid's thirst for knowledge had never been reduced and his enthusiasm for engineering and science was growing. A short while later, Jeff McClellan, the principal of MC2 Stem was immediately impressed by David's dedication in the face of adversity, as well as his academic talent. \n\"Here's a kid who's doing everything in his power to get where he wants to go and we had the available resources to provide a little additional support, \"Mr McClellan told the local ABC News. \nAt MC2 Stem, David found the exact fit, where it seems he was born to absorb what they were offering. Principal Jeff McClellan found David to be a great student and all-around person, but with a serious living situation, so he stepped in to help. After a home discussion with his wife, McClellan decided to offer David a place to live until he could find another home. Mr McClellan and his wife took the teen in and helped him before he found a permanent solution. \n     When it came to his next step, David aimed high and applied for a list of top colleges, including the University of Pennsylvania, MIT, Princeton, Cornell, Yale, Harvard and Washington University in St. Louis. In the end, only MIT rejected his application and he was left to choose his own fate from the selective prestigious and mostly Ivy League schools. \nDavid's next challenge is to fight back tears at graduation this weekend. \"I promised myself I wouldn't cry. But I realize that's what everyone does before they cry. I'm pretty sure there's going to be a lot of emotion there.\" he said.",

They just leave that to the mother bear.\nThe Assassin Bug \nSize matters, you say? This little bug would eat its own eggs to stay strong and fulfill its hunger needs. The male assassin bug is actually responsible for guarding the eggs. The female assassin bug lays eggs in large numbers. The male bug eats the weaker eggs.\nDaddy Bass \nUsually, water calms you down. Not so much for this underwater species. The male bass is known to eat up eggs from its own spawn.

Some animals have the same code.\"\n     Scientists recently discovered that animals that live in groups, such as elephants, foxes, and wolves, are especially likely to follow rules. If they don't, and each does its own thing, the group might break apart. Group members would be forced to live alone. Then they'd have a harder time hunting and raising their young.\n    That's probably why a traveling wolf pack stopped and waited to let its slowly moving leader catch up. Similar social ties may have caused a captive elephant to save her friend from drowning. Selfish reasons certainly motivated the male fox, who wanted to keep playing.\nSometimes, though, animals go out of their way to do what's right, even when there's nothing in it for them. Nobody knows why. \" It might simply feel good to be kind, just as it does for humans,\"  says Bekoff.\n     If your friend wasn't nice to you, what would you do? Maybe you would just walk away. That's exactly what a wild red fox did when she was play-boxing with another fox. The larger fox, a male, began pushing too hard. The little female didn't like fighting. She ran away quickly.\n     \" He still wanted to play,\" says Marc Bekoff. So the male fox ran after his playmate, bowed down, and rolled over. His body language meant, \" Don't leave, I'll play nicely.\" The female gave him another chance, and the male wrestled more gently this time.",

What you often consider plentiful here, such as nails or hammers, is in great need in other parts of the world.\n* Do the project together, not on your own. You are a guest in the community. The most successful result is not that you build something and walk away, but that you and the community build something as a team. Share skills and build together.\n* Be flexible. Not everything is going to happen as planned. Often the other country doesn't have the right tools, manpower, transportation or funds to get all the needed work done. In a word, they lack infrastructure .\n* Contact with the people in the community. Often you will have \"downtime\" outside of the range of the project. Rather than retreat to the group with whom you traveled, be sure to spend time with the people of the community. Listen to the things about their lives. If you can't speak the language, smiles work wonders. And you will be surprised -- you will find a way to community.\nVolunteering is a special and life-long experience for everyone involved. Be prepared that the person who may be changed most is you. It's a joyful, often careful experience which will encourage you to view yourself, your neighbors and your world quite differently.",

        "passage": "They can be seen more frequently than ever before on college campuses, wearing thick-rimmed glasses while listening to indie  music. One might find them playing unusual musical instruments, shopping at second-hand stores or expressing themselves in other unique ways. They call themselves hipsters. Being \"hip\" used to mean following the latest fashion. But gradually the word has evolved into a synonym for \"cool\".\nHipsters value independent thinking, progressive politics, an appreciation of creativity and intelligence. Hipsters take pains and pride in not being mainstream. However, their culture has become quite trendy. This irony is central to their culture and offers an interesting paradox.\n\"I do take things in the mainstream with a grain of salt,\" says Ben Polson, a college student at Brown University in the US. Polson describes himself as a hipster and says he often questions what determines popularity, especially regarding music.When lesser-known bands become popular they often lose their former fan base in exchange for a new one. There is a famous hipster saying that goes: I used to like that band before it got popular.\nAccording to Polson, bands' music changes when they go mainstream. They become \"less experimental, doing things just to save popularity and fans. The original elements that we were drawn to slowly _ for the sake of popularity.\"\nMany young adults have started to view hipsters' outlook as cool and are adopting their counterculture mindset  themselves. This has led to specialized brands, stores and music for the hipster position. Ironically, some such stores, including clothing labels Urban Outfitters and American Apparel, have gained mainstream popularity. This has seemingly diluted  the anti-mainstream culture.\n\"A lot of people that are self-defined hipsters aren't really hipsters, they're just trying to conform to the non-conformist  to seem cooler,\" says Amanda Leopold, a college student from Oberlin College, US. Although Leopold has many unconventional tastes and seems quite individualist, she refuses to classify herself as a hipster.\nThere is a conflict among hipsters about the very definition of the label. To some, to be a hipster is to be free from cultural constraints. To others, it means wearing a certain style and listening to a specific style of music. The former constantly strives for uniqueness, while the latter strives not to be mainstream.\nAnd yet, the movement is gaining mainstream popularity. \"It's kind of the trend these days; _ \" says Leopold. \"There have been hipsters since the seventies. It's only become popular recently.\"\nHipsters reject materialism and laugh at mainstream culture. But are they really beyond material comforts? Do they have any ideas of their own if they despise mainstream so much?\nChristy Wampole, an associate professor of literature at Princeton University, US, is not so sure. She says the hipster is a contradiction in himself and an easy target of mockery . Writing in The New York Times, Wampole paints a less appreciative picture of a typical hipster.\n\"The hipster is a scholar of social forms, a student of cool. He studies continuously, searching for what has yet to be found by the mainstream. He is a walking citation ; his clothes refer to much more than themselves. He tries to negotiate the age-old problem of individuality, not with concepts, but with material things.\"",

        "passage": "Forget Twitter and Facebook, Google and the Kindle. Television is still the most influential medium around. Indeed, for many of the poorest regions of the world, it remains the next big thing--finally becomes globally available. And that is a good thing, because the TV revolution is changing lives for the better.\nAcross the developing world, around 45% of families had a TV in 1995; by 2005 the number had climbed above 60% . That is some way behind the U.S. ,where there are more TVs than people, and where people now easily get access to the Internet. Five million more families in sub-Saharan Africa will get a TV over the next five years. In 2005 , after the fall of the Taliban ,which had banned TV, I in 5 Afghans had one. The global total is another 150 million by 2013--pushing the numbers to well beyond two thirds of families.\nTelevision's most powerful effect will be on the lives of women. In India, researchers Robert Jensen and Emily Oster found that when TVs reached villages, women were more likely to go to the market without their husbands approval and less likely to want a boy rather than a girl. They were more likely to make decisions over child health care. TV is also a powerful medium for adult education. In the Indian state of Gujarat, Chitrageet is a popular show that plays Bollywood songs with words in Gujarati on the screen. Within six months, viewers had made a small but significant improvement in their reading skills.\nToo much TV has been associated with violence, overweight and loneliness. However, TV is having a positive influence on the lives of billions worldwide.",

        "passage": "Names have gained increasing importance in the competitive world of higher education. As colleges struggle for market share, they are looking for names that project the image they want or reflect the changes they hope to make. Trenton State College, for example, became the College of New Jersey nine years ago when it began raising admission standards and appealing to students from throughout the state.\n\"All I hear in higher education is, 'Brand, brand, brand,'\" said Tim Westerbeck, who specializes in branding and is managing director of Lippmann Hearne, a marketing firm based in Chicago that works with universities and other nonprofit organizations. \"There has been a sea change over the last 10 years. Marketing used to be almost a dirty word in higher education.\"\n    Not all efforts at name changes are successful, of course. In 1997, the New School for Social Research becameprefix = st1 /NewSchoolUniversityto reflect its growth into a collection of eight colleges, offering a list of majors that includes psychology, music, urban studies and management. But New Yorkers continued to call it theNewSchool.\nNow, after spending an undisclosed sum on an online survey and a marketing consultant's creation of \"naming structures\", \"brand architecture\" and \"identity systems\", the university has  _ a new name: theNewSchool. Beginning Monday, it will adopt new logos, banners, business cards and even new names for the individual colleges, all to include the words \"theNewSchool\".\n    Changes in names generally show significant changes in how a college wants to be accepted. In changing its name from Cal State, Hayward, to Cal State, East Bay, the university hoped to project its expanding role in two mostly suburban counties east ofSan Francisco.\n    Beaver College turned itself intoArcadiaUniversityin 2001 for several reasons: to break the connection with its past as a women's college, to promote its growth into a full-fledged university and, officials acknowledged, to put an end to jokes about the college's old name on late-night television and \"morning zoo\" radio shows.\nMany college officials said changing a name and image could produce vital results. At Arcadia, in addition to the rise in applications, the average student's test score has increased by 60 points, Juli Roebeck, an Arcadiaspokeswoman, said.",

        "passage": "John Blanchard stood up from the bench, straightened his Army uniform, and studied the crowd of people making their way through Grand Central Station. He looked for the girl whose heart he knew, but whose face he didn't, the girl with the rose.\nHis interest in her had begun thirteen months before in a Florida library. Taking a book off the shelf he found himself intrigued, not with the words of the book, but with the notes penciled in the margin. The soft handwriting reflected a thoughtful soul and insightful mind. In the front of the book, he discovered the previous owner's name, Miss Hollis Maynell. With time and effort he located her address. She lived in New York City. He wrote her a letter introducing himself and inviting her to correspond. The next day he was shipped overseas for service in World War II.\nDuring the next year and one month the two grew to know each other through the mail. Each letter was a seed falling on a fertile heart. A romance was starting Blanchard requested a photograph, but she refused. She felt that if he really cared, it wouldn't matter what she looked like.\nWhen the day finally came for him to return from Europe, they scheduled their first meeting --7:00 PM at the Grand Central Station in New York. \"You'll recognize me,\" she wrote, \"by the red rose I'll be wearing on my lapel.\" So at 7:00 he was in the station looking for a girl whose heart he loved, but whose face he'd never seen.\nI'll let Mr. Blanchard tell you what happened: A young woman was coming toward me, her figure long and slim. Her blonde hair lay back in curls from her delicate ears; her eyes were blue as flowers. Her lips and chin had a gentle firmness, and in her pale green suit she was like springtime come alive. I stared at her, entirely forgetting to notice that she was not wearing a rose. As I moved, a small, attractive smile curved her lips. \"Going my way , sailor?\" she murmured.\nAlmost uncontrollably I made one step closer to her, and then I saw Hollis Maynell. She was standing almost directly behind the girl. A woman well past 40, she had graying hair tucked under a worn hat. She was more than plump, her thick-ankled feet thrust into low-heeled shoes. The girl in the green suit was walking quickly away. I felt as though I was split in two, so keen was my desire to follow her, and yet so deep was my longing for the woman whose spirit had truly companioned me and upheld my own.\nAnd there she stood. Her pale, plump face was gentle and sensible, her gray eyes had a warm and kindly twinkle. I did not hesitate. My fingers gripped the small worn blue leather copy of the book that was to identify me to her.\nThis would not be love, but it would be something precious, something perhaps even better than love, a friendship for which I had been and must ever be grateful. I squared my shoulders and saluted and held out the book to the woman, even though while I spoke I felt choked by the bitterness of my disappointment.  \"I'm Lieutenant John Blanchard, and you must be Miss Maynell. I am so glad you could meet me; may I take you to dinner?\"\nThe woman's face broadened into a tolerant smile. \"I don't know what this is about, son,\" she answered, \"but the young lady in the green suit who just went by, she begged me to wear this rose on my coat. And she said if you were to ask me out to dinner, I should go and tell you that she is waiting for you in the big restaurant across the street. She said it was some kind of test!\"\nIt's not difficult to understand and admire Miss Maynell's wisdom. The true nature of a heart is seen in its response to the unattractive. \"Tell me whom you love,\" Houssaye wrote, \"And I will tell you who you are. \"",

His generous donation is the same size as New York City's Central Park. It is said that it's the largest land donation to happen in the last 25 years.\nHow did he come up with this idea?

Rainforests have a great effect on the world environment because they can take in heat from the sun and adjust the climate. Without the forest cover,these areas would reflect more heat into the atmosphere, warming the rest of the world. Losing the rainforests may also influence wind and rainfall patterns,potentially causing certain natural disasters all over the world.\nIn the past hundred years,humans have begun destroying rainforests in search of three major resources : land for crops,wood for paper and other products,land for raising farm animals. This action affects the environment as a whole. For example,a lot of carbon dioxide in the air comes from burning the rainforests. People obviously have a need for the resources we gain from cutting trees but we will suffer much more than we will benefit.\nThere are two main reasons for _ . Firstly,when people cut down trees,generally they can only use the land for a year or two. Secondly,cutting large sections of rainforests may provide a good supply of wood right now,but in the long run it actually reduces the world's wood supply.\nRainforests are often called the world's drug store. More than 25% of the medicines we use today come from plants in rainforests. However,fewer than l%of rainforest plants have been examined for their medical value.

The typical person said that he / she read four books in the last year and, excluding those who had not read any books at all, the usual number of books read was seven.\nOf those who did read, women and pensioners   were the most eager readers, and religious works and popular fiction were the top choices. The number of books read was nine books for women and five for men. The number also showed that those with college degrees read the most, and people aged 50 and over read more than those who are younger.\nPeople from the West and Midwest are more likely to have read at least one book in the past year. Southerners who do read tend to read more books -- mostly religious books and romance novels -- than people from other regions.\nThose who said they never attend religious services read nearly twice as many books as those who attend frequently, but the Bible and religious works were read by two thirds of the people in the survey, more than all the other categories. Popular fiction, histories, biographies and mysteries took up about half, while one in five read romance novels. Politics, poetry and classical literature were named by fewer than 5% of readers. More women than men read every major category of books except for history and biography books. Men tend to prefer non-fiction.\nBook sales in the US have been flat in recent years and are expected to stay that way, which, experts think, results from competition from the Internet and other media, and the unsteady economy.",

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a group established by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Program, reports that the average surface temperature of the earth has increased during the twentieth century by 0.6deg _ 0.2degC.(The _ 0.2degC means that the increase might be as small as 0.4degC or as great as 0.8degC). This may seem like a small shift, but although regional and short--term temperatures do fluctuate  over a wide range, global temperatures are generally quite stable. In fact, the difference between today's average global temperature and the average global temperature during the last Ice Age is only about 5 degrees C. Indeed, it's warmer today around the world than at any time during the past 1,000years, and the warmest years of the previous century have occurred within the past decade.\nWe also know that human activities--primarily the burning of fossil fuels--have increased the greenhouse gas content of the earth's atmosphere significantly over the same period. Carbon dioxide is one of the most important greenhouse gases, which trap heat near the planet's surface.\nThe vast majority of climate researchers agree with these overall findings. The scientific disagreements that do still exist primarily concern detailed aspects of the processes that make up these largely accepted general themes.\nYou can think of this website as a window into the world of scientific research. In this primer, you'll find a general discussion of the physical processes underlying the earth's climate, an outline of the kinds of data that may shed light on how the climate is changing--and the role of human activity in these changes--and a description a some of the questions and uncertainties that researchers continue to explore.

A dog can be a pleasant companion to your family, but if you choose the wrong kind of dog , you will have a lot of troubles.\nFamilies should sit down and discuss the possible problems before buying a dog. Even if the children in your family are the ones who want the dog, the parents are the ones who are really responsible for seeing that the animal is properly cared for. If you don't know much about dogs, it is a good idea to go to the library for books about different kinds of dogs, and books about how to train a young dog. In reading about the different breeds you should know that a dog described as very alert may be too active. When a book describes a dog as an excellent hunting dog, it probably means that the dog won't be happy living in a small house. Dog breeds vary in popularity as the years go by. One of the most popular dogs these days is the German shepherd. This is because it provides protection as well as companionship. The family should be warned that these dogs grow up to be very big, and may be too powerful for children to control. If space is limited, a toy dog may be a good choice. These dogs are very small and easy to train. They don't need to be walked daily, since they can exercise in the home.",

He collected and recorded traditional American folk music, which had few fans at that time. When he heard Woody sing, Lomax knew he had found a true singer of American folk music. Lomax recorded many of Woody's songs for the Library of Congress. \n         Three years later, Woody published a book called Bound for Glory. It was about his early life and travels. From this book people came to learn how Woody had spent his unhappy youth. His mother, Nora Guthrie, died of Huntington's Disease   in 1929 when he was only seventeen years old. There was no treatment for the disease. About twenty years later, the disease also began to attack the son. Woody's health got worse and worse, and finally he entered a hospital.    \n         While Woody seemed to be forgotten, his music was not. By the late 1950s, folk music became popular in America. More Americans began listening and playing the songs of Woody Guthrie. Young folk singers came to New York to visit Woody in the hospital. Among them was Bob Dylan, one of America's greatest popular songwriters. He called Woody his hero. Dylan and others copied the way Woody sang and played the guitar. And like Woody, they wrote songs that called for social and political justice  .   \n         Woody Guthrie stayed in the hospital until he died in 1967. In the last years of his life, Woody could hardly speak. But his family and friends knew he still believed in the causes he had sung and written about all his life. They knew this because when they sang his songs, Woody's eyes would become brighter and his defiant   spirit would shine through.",

Though hurt and disappointed, he took a part in a tiny, unknown TV film in 2001. No one noticed his performance - no one except screenwriter Richard Curtis.

Firth then joined a film called The Last Legion and supported Thomas for its lead role. As a result, the boy played Rome's final ruler in the action-adventure.\nAt about 16, Thomas had to make a decision. Did he really want to devote his life to acting? Many people in the public \"aren't letting you be you because they see you as something special\", he says. Also, friendship made during filming was often broken soon after the project finished. Despite these things, he found enough joy and satisfaction in the work to continue. Actually, Thomas seems to find joy in difficulty itself. He played 10-year-old Adolf Hitler in a TV movie and a teenage Paul McCartney in Nowhere Boy. The subject of his film Death of a Superhero made it his most challenging film. Still, he found a positive message in its story of a schoolboy with cancer.\nThomas now enjoys roles in Game of Thrones and the upcoming Maze Runner films.

But after the hustle and bustle of a few weeks, excitement gives way to a less enjoyable emotion-- homesickness.\nHomesickness manifests itself in many ways. You may miss mum's cooking, your pets, or even your old bed. All this becomes a fond memory of the past. Homesickness can be a bitter feeling for many students, especially when faced with the challenges of settling into an unfamiliar environment.\nBut remember, you're not alone. According to a recent BBC article, 70 percent of British college students experience homesickness. In this increasingly globalized world in which people migrate to faraway places for a relationship, education or work, homesickness is a feeling shared by many adults.\nHomesickness can have similar symptoms to depression and in extreme cases it can develop into a panic attack. As for the term, homesickness or nostalgia wasn't invented until the 17th century. It was considered a disorder by a Swiss physician, who attributed soldiers' mental and physical discomfort to their longing to return home, \"nostos\" from Greek, and the accompanying pain, \"algos\".\nStudies in recent years, however, have shown that nostalgia may have some benefits to our mental health. After a decade of surveys and researches, Constantine Sedikides, a US social psychologist, found that nostalgia is what makes us human. He explains that nostalgia can resist loneliness, boredom and anxiety. Therefore, it's necessary for college students to learn some ways to overcome the uncomfortable feeling.",

I was living in Farley. It's about thirty miles away. I came back to London two months ago.\" I also wondered if it was the custom for boys to fight strangers like me, but I was tall for my age. I hoped they would decide not to risk it.\nNo one took any notice of me before school. I stood in the center of the playground, expecting someone to say \"hello\", but no one spoke to me.

There were 42 boys in the class, so _ , either, until the first lesson of the afternoon. Mr. Jones was very fond of Charles Dickens and he had decided to read aloud to us from David Copperfield, but first he asked several boys if they knew Dickens' birthplace, but no one guessed right. A boy called Brian, the biggest in the class, said: \"Timbuktu\", and Mr. Jones went red in the face. Then he asked me. I said: \"Portsmouth\", and everyone stared at me because Mr. Jones said I was right. This didn't make me very popular, of course.\n\"He thinks he's clever,\" I heard Brian say.\nAfter that, we went out to the playground to play football. I was in Brian's team, and he obviously had Dickens in mind because he told me to go in goal.

As the boy kicked the ball to my right, I threw myself down instinctively   and saved it. All my team crowded round me. My bare knees were injured and bleeding.

Generally forbidden by law in earlier days, the fighting was usually done with bare fists, and matches often lasted forty or fifty rounds.\nIn 1882 John L. Sullivan, a fighter of great power, won the world heavyweight championship from Paddy Ryan in a bare fisted battle marked by hitting, scratching, and biting without any rule. Five years later, while fighting Patsy Cardiff at Minneapolis, Sullivan broke his right arm in the third round, but he continued fighting to the sixth round and won. In 1889, Sullivan defeated Jade Kilrain with his bare fists in another championship fight, winning twenty thousand dollars and a diamond prize medal. His admirers talked then of running him for the next governor, but he traveled to Australia for a boxing tour instead, coming back only to lose his title in a twenty-one-round match with a young Californian named James J. Corbett.\n\"Gentleman James\" victory in this match marked a turning point, for it showed scientific boxing was over strength. But Corbett's title ended in 1897, when another boxer, Bob Fitzsimmons, in less than three seconds, achieved his feats and then Fitzsimmons knocked out an Irishman, won the heavyweight championship of the world, and invented the terrible \"solar plexus punch.\"",

They shouted at the ruins again and again,knocked the bricks using various tools,but no reply inside.\nThen the rescuing team went to the next building. Suddenly the leader ran back,calling \"Come here.\" He came to the body,put his hands under the woman,feeling and touching,then shouted loudly and gladly,\"There is someone,a baby,still living.\"\nThrough some efforts,rescuers cleaned up the ruins which blocked her. Under her body lay her baby,who was covered by a small red quilt . He was about 3 or 4 months' old. Since well protected by his mother's body,he was safe. He was in a deep sleep when the rescuer carried him out,and his lovely and peaceful face warmed everyone around him. The doctor,along with the rescuing team,took the baby out of the quilt to check if the baby was all right,and he found there was a mobile phone in the quilt. The doctor looked at the screen;a written message was already there:\"My dear baby,if you could live,don't forget how much I love you.\" As a doctor,he experienced much of this type of separation;but at this moment,he cried.

Choose the one that fits best according to the information given in the passage.\n \nIt may be open to discussion which city is the most beautiful in the world. But in terms of \" the most livable\", Melbourne has ranked top in a survey done by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) in August. In fact, four cities Down Under are among the top ten most livable cities.\nThe climate in Australia is warm and mild, particularly in major coastal cities. As a result, people spend much time outdoors. They go to the beach, to the countryside, or play sports outdoors in fields. \nTake Melbourne for example. The city features many open green spaces and beautiful long beaches. Melburnians \n(people from Melbourne) have a strong love for sports. The city hosts the annual Australia Open, \nthe Formula One Grand Prix, cricket, rugby and homegrown football. It is also home to museums, art exhibitions and drama festivals.\nThe comfortable environment has encouraged many people to migrate  to the country and Australia is known for being very multicultural or its cultural diversity .\n\"We have tried to introduce a sense of belonging in Australia,\" said Chris Bowen, the Australian Minister for Immigration . \"Multiculturalism is about inviting every individual member of society to be everything they can be ... to develop as individuals.\"\nThis could be the reason behind another Australia quality that Guardian reporter Stephen Brook has noticed: Australians do patriotism  much better than the Brits.\n\"I once witnessed two Australian viewers at a tennis tournament show more support for the Aussie player than the rest of the British arena,\" he wrote.\nIt is also an Australian tradition to stand up for the  _ . In the 2000 Olympic Games, the Sydney public watches an African swimmer who was barely able to swim 50 meters. Even though most people in the stands knew that even they could have swum better than him at that point, they cheered his every stroke  as if he were on his way to a good medal. During the 2003 Rugby World Cup, the level of support they showed for the Japanese team surprised viewers since Japan had little hope of winning. \n\"Australians don't need to be victorious in order to feel like a worthy person. When they cheer for the underdog, seeing other human beings having the courage to take on hardship, they get the emotional satisfaction they need,\" wrote a blogger on convictcreations.com, a website dedicated to Australian culture.",

        "passage": "As people have accurately observed,smiles are absent from early photographs. In 1852,for instance,a girl sat for her Daguerrotype,her head slightly turned,giving the camera an unsmiling look. She is preserved forever as a very serious girl indeed. Charles Darwin,a loving and playful parent,looks frozen in photographs. Why did our ancestors,from unknown sitters for family portraits  to the great and famous,because so sad in front of the camera?\nThe severity is everywhere in Victorian photographs. However,you don't have to look very long at these unsmiling old photos to see how incomplete the seemingly obvious answer is-that they are freezing their faces in order to keep still for the long exposure times. In Julia Margaret Cameron's Portrait of Tennyson,the poet dreams,his face a shadowed mask of genius. This is not simply a technique. It's an emotional choice.\nPeople in the past did not go around in a continual state of sorrow. In fact,the Victorians had a sense of humor even about the darkest aspects of their society. Laughter was not just common in the past but accepted by society far more than it is today,from medieval carnivals  to Georgian print shops,where people gathered to look at the latest funnies. Far from preventing festivals and fun,the Victorians,who invented photography,also created Christmas as a celebration as it is today. So the severity of people in the 19th-century photographs cannot be the evidence of generalized sadness. This was not a society in permanent desperation. Instead,the true answer has to do with attitudes to portraiture itself.\nPeople who sat for early photographs understood it as a significant moment. Sitting for the camera was cheaper,quicker and meant that people who never had a chance to be painted could now be photographed; but people seemed to have taken it seriously in the same way they would be a painted portrait. Like a portrait painting,it was intended as a timeless record of a person.\nTo me those unsmiling people probably had as much fun as we do,if not more. But they felt no need to prove it with pictures. Instead,when whey sat for a photograph,they thought about time,death and memory. Perhaps we should stop smiling sometimes,too.",

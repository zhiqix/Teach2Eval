The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: First of all, every son of Leo is a grandson of Barton or a great-grandfather of Lawrence. Next, being a grandson of Barton is sufficient for not being an uncle of Jacob. Plus,being a great-grandfather of Lawrence is sufficient for not being an uncle of Jacob. Hence, being a son of Leo is sufficient for not being an uncle of Jacob.\"\n Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?",

        "question": "\"Is Fred a fan of Liverpool? Are supporters of Real Madrid devotees of PSG? In European football, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of the mutual admiration and dislike. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: To begin with, every backer of FC Ufa is a devotee of Wolverhampton Wanderers FC or an admirer of Lyngby BK or a devotee of Alashkert FC. Moreover, whoever is a devotee of Wolverhampton Wanderers FC is not a follower of KF Shkëndija. Finally, every admirer of Lyngby BK is a follower of KF Shkëndija. So, necessarily, whoever is a backer of FC Ufa is not a follower of KF Shkëndija or a devotee of Alashkert FC.\"\n Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?",

        "question": "\"Is Titanium oxide an ingredient of my washing power? Which chemicals does my perfume contain? It is really difficult to keep track of all chemicals one is regularly exposed to. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: First, Phenacemide is an ingredient of I Own The Runway or an ingredient of Lime All The Time. Second, not being an ingredient of Victoria's Secret is sufficient for being an ingredient of I Own The Runway and an ingredient of Lime All The Time. We may conclude: It is false that Phenacemide is an ingredient of Victoria's Secret.\"\n Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?",

The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: To begin with, being an ingredient of real color nail 114 is sufficient for not being an ingredient of Silver, nail enamel. Moreover, to be an ingredient of Silver, nail enamel or an ingredient of Trugel Rich Cherry is necessary for being an ingredient of real color nail 114. So, necessarily, being an ingredient of real color nail 114 is sufficient for being an ingredient of Trugel Rich Cherry.\"\n Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?",

Every country except America was behind on their 'committment' to paying their fair share for NATO, and to my knowledge, all except us were not paying their share to be in the UN. So given the current situation, do you really, really believe these same countries are going to voluntarily pay?? I don't think so either.",

To me the main reason this is happening is because over the last few decades women en masse left child rearing behind in favour of making money so the Boomers are by far the wealthiest generation ever and they can offer their money (instead of the parental presence that they subcontracted to paid help and the child care industry) to their children.  No previous \"middle class\" in human history had the dough the Boomers do, so they use it as the wealthy always have, i.e. as a carrot to bind their \"adult children\" to them and to encourage the desired behavior from them.  And most of the kids can't resist the dough, so they stay close to the watering hole.",

There is no norm that tells us what passing is on the tests or what they were based upon. Some might remember before the HSGQE was used, it was given about 4 or 5 times and there were many different statistics that were looked at before it was \"officially used\" that broke down every question and whether or not it had any cultural or racial issues. The current test was quickly put together after cancelling the contract with the prior tester. There wasn't time to take a look at the questions, but hey, let's panic and demand changes based on some half-baked \"facts\".",

They are different in terms of compensation from doctors in that they have pensions and benefits.   How would they feel if a government unilaterally stopped their pension plan and gave them a 10% pay cut?  That is in effect what Morneau and Trudeau are doing to small businesses and medical doctors.     The greater worry is the Canada could be killing any benefit from being a risk taking entrepreneur.    If they stop innovated, investing and creating businesses then Canada's economy will suffer.",

Yes, nuclear is beautiful, safe, clean and essential. I also want a Bentley Continental. I will drive my 1400 until I can afford better. The country should be run like a household.\n\nA large part of our current problems in electricity cost was created by Eskom's wasteful behaviour in both coal supply contracts and in the construction of the new coal plants (They are as expensive as similar sized nuclear plants - R 500bn - 9.6GW). Eskom also has probably the highest average worker income of any company in SA, and a growing labour force, in spite of falling demand. \n\nWe used to be the ferrochrome capital of the world. Escom paid the then Xtrata and other firms to shut down 80% of the smelters. China now imports our ore and sends the finished product back to us. You really want to give them a blank cheque?\n\nHad to get that off my chest.",

Putin still would have hacked the election in Trump's favor, legitimate doubt would have been cast on the feasibility of Sanders' economic platform, and other aspects of his past positions as senator would have been brought up. You'd also have to assume that all that toxic racism generated by Trump would have been checked by the hope that Sanders was campaigning on. In retrospect, I'd say the racist instinct would still have won, especially with Putin's role in the election. It would have been interesting to see how Putin would have approached delegitimizing Sanders through wikileaks. Maybe that happened in an alternate universe somewhere and they're writing now about how Sanders blew it. Either way, Putin held the wildcard and his favorite was Trump.",

The fact that there has been a massive amount of anti-Saudi comment in social media since The Chump's visit suggests that the wall of silence about these medieval warlords and their backing of terrorism - remember 9/11? - is breaking. The Corbyn surge in the UK, and Macron in France seems to me to be an indication of this, too. Even - dare I say it - the rise of The Chump himself is a result (although too extreme, which worries me of course) of the fact that people are gatvol with the existing political system and want a bigger say - and participation in the benefits of - in the way their country is run.

On the other hand, the BIG problem is people accused of murder and other serious crimes getting off because the case takes too long to get to court. Since those cases are the ones where a preliminary hearing is still important, those cases won't be helped by Naqvi's suggestion but I guess it will reduce load on the system in the majority of cases.

Peaceful protest that doesn't interfere with the flow of the game isn't offensive to me. Forced patriotism is not American at all. That's more like what the citizens of North Korea experience. You also have the right to not patronize the NFL as a result of the protest. My question is what is so offensive about the protest?  Muhammad Ali faced the same vitriol in his time but became one of America's my beloved and celebrated athletes.",

Please choose the option that best fits the content of this comment.\ntext:    Now dammit she sent me an email specifically saying she opposed considering any nominee because of the BS \"eighty year precedent\" that was quickly disproven. She didn't say she would prefer Obama leave the decision to his successor she specifically said she would not do her damned job. Now Ms. Martinson is enabling her to walk back that stand to make her sound more reasonable and less partisan. She was for it then she was against it and now because she is facing a very credible challenge for reelection by Margaret Stock and a barrage of emails, calls and letters from Alaskans telling her to simply do her job she is back peddling again. She thought she could get away with the dishonest \"eighty year tradition\" or the \"Biden rule\" all the while knowing the truth behind those sound bites were not what she was inferring. Keep up the pressure folks and check out Stock's website. She's a highly credentialed and qualified Independent who would make a great replacement for Lisa. Be the change.",

What this initiative would do is deny trans people use of public bathrooms. They do not want attention or drama. Any time ANYONE (no matter their gender, race, religion, etc.) assaults you in any way while you are in a public bathroom you should take appropriate legal steps. When such things occur it is very rare that a transgender person is the perpetrator. Look up the statistics. Assaults by transgender people in public bathrooms are almost nonexistent. Assaults on transgender people are not as rare. And this initiative will only cause that horrible stat to rise, though. This initiative doesn't protect our children.

How does encouraging the dismemberment of a major European nation, whether Britain or Spain, by holding out the promise of membership to break away entities achieve this aim? Britain is a stalwart member of NATO and the five eyes security alliance including United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. A diminished, dismembered British partner is bound to have a deleterious effect. It is hard to discount the importance of the sovereignty and integrity of nations. There is  powerful argument that the EU sucks up too much of the oxygen necessary for national self-determination and fully functioning democracy. That Scotland is abusing Britain's attempt to redefine its relationship with the EU is proof that the EU has morphed into dangerous territory.",

The church forms consciences by reflecting on Scripture, Tradition and the lived experience of the church, but goes beyond its biblical mandate when attempting to impose a \"one-size fits all\" discipline.  Whether an individual person or couple is in a \"sinful relationship\" is a judgment made between them, their confessor and their God.  Francis is simply -- finally -- calling us to spiritual adulthood.\nThe world does not consist of neatly constructed round and square holes and round and square pegs; lots of pegs just don't fit in pre-fabricated holes.",

Bubble Gum Music\n5. Country Rock\n6. Heavy Metal\n7. Reggae\n8. Rap/Hip Hop\n9. Glam Rock\n10. Arena Rock\n11. Punk Rock\n\nOne of the secrets, I suspect: she didn't have much competition in her easy-going MOR niche. Many performed and recorded similar material, but made it bigger in another genre (Elton John would be one.) Regret that this sounds like \"damning with faint praise,\" but many of us can name excellent \"acts\" or artists that never sold much of anything, simply because the competition was just too fierce in their own niche; the grind was too tough. I know of one, personally, who released 3 Canadian singles (one went to #10 nationwide), an album (which he helped write and produce himself) and gave it up.  He was a postman for over 30 years...",

You going to invite them all in to your living room too?  \n\nThe sheer numbers are part of the problem here.  A Senator represents 5.5 million people in CO, vs around 800k for a Representative.  Activists are swarming House members too but not in the numbers going after Gardner.  And before you compare it to Bennett, remember that hardly anyone cares what Bennett says or does.  (1) he's Bennett, and (2) he's in the minority without much power.  Although if we ever find ourselves in the unlikely spot of getting to a \"replace\" bill that needs 60 votes after a \"repeal\" bill passes first, Bennett may be on the hot seat himself with conservative activists shutting down his town halls.  \n\nYes, Gardner has an obligation to listen to his constituents. And he offers ways for you to make yourself heard. You just don't like the ways provided, since they prevent the town hall publicity stunts.",

They jump on bandwagons (Like the Grateful Dead, Phish, Bernie, etc)  but mid-term elections just don't seem to get their attention.  It is sad, really - laziness, mostly, but also, progressive folks in general are just not as likely to think about politics when other things are happening.  That's why there is so much right-wing talk radio and none on the liberal side.  It has nothing to do with who is right or wrong, or how many people believe what, it is just that no liberal person I know has any desire to listen to someone drone on and on about how great they are and how much right-wingers suck.  That is a Conservative fetish.  Unfortunately, it does lead to gross mid-term election defeats.\n\nA middle road of political awareness would serve progressives well...How hard is it to vote once every 2 years, for goodness' sake??",

These are people and cultures that have never created peace and prosperity in their entire histories. Why would relocating them to Canada be any benefit to Canada?

I work with a guy, same job as me, same pay as me, but he started as a low-skill entry level employee out of high school and moved up from there.   He started life without tens of thousands of dollars of debt, and he got 4 more years of earnings, and is 4 years ahead in life (will pay off mortgage 4 years earlier, retire 4 years earlier, etc.)   And since that time, the cost and payoff of going to university or college have just continued to diverge.  Besides, these days it's different.  Companies don't invest in their employees like they used to.  On the flipside you can get a legit degree online for free or close to free.  If learning rather than credentials is what you're after, you can learn your butt off for free online and in community settings these days.  Doesn't cost a penny.",

We may be starting to see the radiation intensity approaching what radar technicians have seen in the past. \n\nThis research should continue because not all technicians have been affected the same way. Moreover, we should have more surveys of people in high-radiation environments. Other sensitivities such as cancer may be possible at higher radiation intensities. \n\nIn particular low-frequency radiation of people who live near power lines has been controversial for many years.

This line is particularly incorrect: \n\n\"Talent, not scheme, is what wins in the NFL.\"\n\nI hate the Pats, but they have two things that help them win consistently: a great QB, and coaching schemes. They *don't* have superior talent at the skill positions (except Gronk)! I wouldn't trade our WR corps for theirs. I wouldn't trade our stable of RBs for theirs. \n\nWe're trying to find out if we have a QB, but (as Elway and 300 said) the right system is really, really important.",

It isn't called \"the dismal science\" for nothing. If you are going to read just one major work in economics, I would suggest Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations. It is a slog in places, and I certainly don't agree with everything he says, but it is one of those books that any educated person should be familiar with.\n\nWhen I was taking a 19th century English history course, my professor told me that I was going to write my term paper on the economics of imperialism. (Everyone else in the class was given his or her own choice.) I asked why, and he said that I would understand when I started doing the research. I went to the library, and right off the bat, I found the book Imperialism by John Hobson. Compared to Imperialism, Karl Marx's Capital is scintillating.",

Whether it is the doctor billing outrageous amounts or the health insurance companies screwing the little guys. Redirecting of funds away from those companies is necessary to get their attention. They have a monopoly on the market and people have no choices.\n\nMy son recently went to the ICU for breathing issues. Spent 1 day in ICU with a bill of $25k. I pay almost $17k a year to Premera and I had to pay the first $10k of my sons bill. My healthcare cost me $27k this year before Premera pays a penny. Thats broken. Selling that to the population that they are covered should be fraudulent. Many people don't learn this until they have to use their insurance. Shame on us.\n\nBen Carson actually had good plans for Healthcare. He was my pick. \n\nAll in all, i'd rather have no ACA than ACA as written.",

After all, we've seen that play before.\n\nEven the FBI's and Homeland Security's latest \"evidence\", taken at face value, doesn't prove interference by a foreign state. Anyone could have written it. Its weight depends entirely on the credibility of the agencies offering it. However, their past sins over Iraq's WMD, their warlike view of Russia, and a reputation both for telling their masters what they want to hear and for exaggerating foreign threats in pursuit of expanded budgets and powers, have undermined their credibility quite severely. They can't have it both ways.\n\nIt's also deeply ironic. Liberals defend Snowden, Wikileaks et al as people who simply expose the truth of official wrongdoing. The DNC leakers did the same, but liberals treat them as enemies of the state. It looks like a double standard to me.",

The US has been snooping, hacking and subverting all manner of sovereign states in the last 120 years. Since 1945, 40 foreign governments have been overthrown by the US, either through covert subversion or outright war; the CIA even managed to have ousted the government of Australian PM Gough Whitlam in 1975. The US even hacked into Angela Merkel's phone.  \n\nYet John McCain considers it an act of war if Russia hacked into private (Clinton and Podesta) US emails. The US then has waged unprovoked war on 40 countries since WW2, by his own estimation. \n\nTalk about the teapot calling the kettle black! \n\nThe US Industrial-Military-Security complex is getting desperate for new wars to feed their addiction to war profits. They will now have their puppets in the US governent say anything to undermine the Trump presidency and his goal of diverting war resources to domestic infrastructure and fair international trade.",

I will be a little crude here because the simple answer is crude. A CATHOLIC following his/her faith cannot ever vote for a candidate who is pro choice especially if the opposing one is pro life. Catholics must vote pro life.. Trump is no Saint, and certainly tied in with the elitists.  If you Bishop or Priest told you you must vote your heart, they are not telling you that you can fall into mortal sin. So the lesser of 2 evils is the choice. Now  they call the LEFT the LEFT for a reason. The left is progressive and therefore waters down or downright does not believe in God, never mind the Satanist who are also part of the left. Jesus separates the goats from the sheep. The Goats go on the LEFT.. Sometimes the answer you seek is right in front of you (pun intended) We must trust in God, and never vote against LIFE",

I think half the problem is that school boards have to deal with ornery adolescents who sometimes do provocative (and sometimes stupid) things to get attention, so they just ban everything.  Also, they have to deal with the phone calls from a handful of semi-functional and constantly irate parents who complain about everything.\n\nMaybe I'll dress as Iggy Pop and yell \"no fun.\"",
